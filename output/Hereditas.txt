                Results
                A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1/2005 (A/QH) was able to infect A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells, with a high infection rate for A549 cells. To identify host cellular responses of human cells to influenza infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AIV-infected groups and uninfected controls were identified using RNA-sequencing. The DEGs were annotated by Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, which revealed that the DEGs were mainly linked to cellular function and metabolic processes, while the cellular function that is probably associated with host cellular response of human cells, including defense response to virus and protein modification. All the DEGs and pathways were possibly involved in the response to IAV invasion.

                The global transcriptome analysis results revealed that sensitive genes and pathways of the cells were infected with the influenza virus and provided further evidence to investigate the complicated relationship between IAV and host cells.
              "	"H5N1 influenza virus;Differentially expressed genes;Signaling pathway;Transcriptomic"	"Influenza is one of the commonest respiratory infectious diseases of humans. Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the influenza A genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. The threat of IAV to human health is significant and continual, which could be in the form of seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics [1]. It has been estimated that more than 50 million people globally have died from influenza [2]. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has infected thousands of people and spread globally in transported poultry or via indirect contact [3, 4]. Currently, it is impossible to eliminate the virus during its infection [5].Host defenses against IAV infection are provoked by the innate immune system after virus attachment to target cells [6]. During infections of viruses, innate immune responses are triggered when viruses or their genetic material are detected by cellular pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system [7â<U+0080><U+0093>9]. Influenza viruses such as H5N1 and the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus could infect and induce excessive inflammatory immune responses which are associated with elevated morbidity as well as mortality [10, 11]. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the regulation of the balance between the protective and pathological immune responses under infection with various strains of influenza virus are still required to be elaborated.Transcriptomic analyses of the host cellular responses to viruses infection can be employed to investigate potential cellular factors that are related to viral infection either directly or indirectly [12]. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, a recently developed transcriptome profiling approach, combined with bioinformatics has become an important tool in the exploration of cellular signaling mechanisms. RNA-seq technology can be used to uncover dynamic alterations in the pathogen genome itself and systemic changes in host gene expression profiles during the process of infection by pathogens. Thus, RNA-seq technology could be useful in identifying the pathogenesis and mechanisms of the infection and interaction of pathogens. RNA-seq has been applied to study various viral infections and diseases, and previous studies primarily focused on the differing virulence of influenza virus strains [13, 14].In the current study, RNA-seq was employed to annotate host responses to infection with H5N1 influenza viruses in 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T and A549 cells. The differential virus replication in A549 and 293â<U+0080><U+0089>T cells uncovered potential candidate gene that may be correlated with the observed resilience of human cells to highly pathogenic influenza virus infection. The global survey of virus type-specific and cell-specific mRNA profiles demonstrate the role and mechanism of host-virus cellular responses during influenza virus infection and demonstrate a signature response of the cells infected with the H5N1 influenza virus. We believe that this information will aid in the development of vaccines and other control strategies."

Fructans are abundant in tubers and represent the foundation for their formation, processing and utilization of yield; and are also widely used in new sugar-based materials, bioenergy processing, ecological management, and functional feed. To identify key genes in the metabolic pathway of fructans in Jerusalem artichoke, high-throughput sequencing was performed using Illumina Hi Seqâ<U+0084>¢ 2500 equipment to construct a transcriptome library.              ;
                Results
                Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Jerusalem artichoke â<U+0080><U+009C>Qingyu No.1â<U+0080> was used as the material; roots, stems, leaves, flowers and tubers of Jerusalem artichoke in its flowering stage were mixed into a mosaic of the Jerusalem artichoke transcriptome library, obtaining 63,089 unigenes with an average length of 713.6â<U+0080><U+0089>bp. Gene annotation through the Nr, Swiss Prot, GO, KOG and KEGG databases revealed 34.95 and 46.91% of these unigenes had similar sequences in the Nr and Swiss Prot databases. The GO classification showed the Jerusalem artichoke unigenes were divided into three ontologies, with a total of 49 functional groups encompassing biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Among them, there were more unigenes involved in the functional groups for cellular processes, metabolic processes, and single-organism processes. 38,999 unigenes were annotated by KOG and divided into 25 categories according to their functions; the most common annotation being general function prediction. A total of 13,878 unigenes (22%) were annotated in the KEGG database, with the largest proportion corresponding to pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. A total of 12 unigenes were involved in the synthesis and degradation of fructan. Cluster analysis revealed the candidate 12 unigene proteins were dispersed in the 5 major families of proteins involved in fructan synthesis and degradation. The synergistic effect of INV gene is necessary during fructose synthesis and degradation in Jerusalem artichoke tuber development. The sequencing data from the transcriptome of this species can provide a reliable data basis for the identification and assessment of the expression of the members of the INV gene family.A simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci search was performed on the transcriptome data of Jerusalem artichoke, identifying 6635 eligible SSR loci with a large proportion of dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats, and the most different motifs were repeated 5 times and 6 times. Dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeat motifs were the most frequent, with AG/CT and ACC/GGT repeat motifs accounting for the highest proportion.

                Conclusions
                In this study, a database search of the transcriptome of the Jerusalem artichoke from the Qinghai Tibet Plateau was conducted by high throughput sequencing technology to obtain important transcriptional and SSR loci information. This allowed characterization of the overall expression features of the Jerusalem artichoke transcriptome, identifying the key genes involved in metabolism in this species. In turn, this offers a foundation for further research on the regulatory mechanisms of fructan metabolism in Jerusalem artichoke.
              "	"                        Helianthus tuberosus L.;Transcriptome;Gene analysis;Simple sequence repeats"	"Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) belongs to the genus Helianthus L. of Asteraceae. Although it is native to temperate zones in North America, it was introduced into China over 300â<U+0080><U+0089>years ago, where it has been planted sporadically as a pickled vegetable for a long time. The twenty-first Century has seen a gradual decrease of the economic value of Jerusalem artichoke, with a rapid expansion in its planting and processing. The Jerusalem artichoke tuber contains fructose, which can be used to process inulin [1], bioethanol [2] and various foods [3]. In addition, because of its strong stress resistance, it can be cultivated in dry and saline alkaline environments, and has also been utilized in the ecological treatment of desert soil [4], seashore saline soil [5] and heavy metal-contaminated soil [6]. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is one of the earliest areas in China to conduct large-scale planting and processing of Jerusalem artichoke. The climate is cold, with large differences in temperature between day and night. The yield of the Jerusalem artichoke tuber is high, due its elevated fructan content. Moreover, it has natural and pollution-free environmental advantages, being very beneficial to the processing of organic fructan products. The industry of Jerusalem artichoke planting and processing has achieved rich development potential in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.Fructose is the third largest storage carbohydrate after starch and sucrose. About 15% of angiosperms contain fructan, most prominently in the Compositae, Liliaceae and Gramineae families; which mostly grow in cold temperate zones [7]. Plant fructan has been studied for over 200â<U+0080><U+0089>years, with early research focused on the biochemical properties of fructans [8]. In recent years, abundant studies have shown fructan metabolism is closely related to plant resistance to cold [9], drought [10] and saline alkali [11], as well as other stressors. With the discovery of the enzymes involved in fructan metabolism, research focus has shifted to the understanding of the metabolic processes and functions of fructosan [12]. In addition to the important role of fructan in plants, processed food derived from this carbohydrate also helps maintain human health. The properties and processing techniques of fructan have been extensively studied [13]. Fructan is an optimal nutrient and sweetener for patients with diabetes and hypertension, as it has a caloric value of only 1â<U+0080><U+0089>kcal/g, and it is not easily digested and decomposed into monosaccharides and therefore does not sharply increase blood glucose [14, 15]. Highly polymerized fructans are often used as substitutes for fats in foods such as yogurt, ice cream and jelly pudding [16].Fructan structure is mainly linear or branched in plants and 5 different types of derivatives. The earliest model of fructan metabolism was proposed by research on Jerusalem artichoke [17]. Jerusalem artichoke is a typical crop that accumulates inulin-type linear fructan. This type is composed of D-fructose residues linked by Î²-2, 1 bonds with molecular weights ranging from 3 to 5â<U+0080><U+0089>kDa [18]. Current models of inulin-type fructan metabolism suggest its synthesis is based on sucrose as a substrate: First, the synthesis of kestose (1-Kestose) is catalyzed by sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST, EC 2.4.1.99), followed by elongation of the fructan chain [19, 20] catalyzed by fructan 1-fructosyltransferase (1-FFT, EC 2.4.1.100). Then, the degradation of fructan is catalyzed by 1-Fructan exohydrolase (1-FEH, EC 3.2.1.80), with the fructosyl being cleaved one by one from the end of the sugar chain. At present, the functions of known key enzymes in the metabolism of Jerusalem artichoke fructan are unclear, and which genes are involved in their metabolic regulation remains to be discovered.In recent years, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing has been widely used to study gene expression in different biological problems. This method can comprehensively and quickly acquire all mRNA sequences [21â<U+0080><U+0093>23] generated by gene expression in a certain state and identify important functional genes from it in order to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying different biological traits. In this study, the transcriptome of Jerusalem artichoke from the Qinghai Tibet Plateau was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology with Illumina Hi Seq 2500 equipment. Functional annotation of genes, and functional classification and metabolic pathway analysis of unigene were carried out with bioinformatics methods to lay a foundation for further research on the key metabolic genes in Jerusalem artichoke, as well as for interpretation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of fructan metabolism, and the development of related molecular markers."

Elymus tangutorum (Nevski) Hand.-Mazz, a cool-season hexaploid perennial, is an important pasture bunchgrass species used for forages and grassland restoration in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and northwest China. In this study, 27 E. tangutorum accessions from diverse origins of western China were evaluated using AFLP markers in an effort to delve into the genetic relationships among them. The effects of eco-environmental factors and geographical isolation on the genetic diversity and population structure were also elucidated.              ;
                Results
                On account of 554 polymorphic fragments amplified with 14 primer combinations, the mean values of some marker parameters including polymorphic information content, resolving power and marker index were 0.2504, 14.10 and 23.07, respectively, validating the high efficiency and reliability of the markers selected. Genetic dissimilarity index values among accessions ranged from 0.1024 to 0.7137 with a mean of 0.2773. STRUCTURE, UPGMA clustering and PCoA analyses showed that all accessions could be divided into the three main clusters; however, this results do not exactly coincide with geographic groups. We found medium differentiation (FSTâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.162) between Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and Xinjiang (XJC), and high differentiation (FSTâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.188) among three Bayesian subgroups. A significant correlation (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.312) between genetic and geographical distance was observed by Mantel test in the species level, while the weak correlation was detected between genetic and environmental distance for all accessions and most of geographical groups. In addition, a significant ecological influence of average annual precipitation on genetic distance was revealed in XJC group and the Bayesian subgroup A.

                Conclusion
                This study indicates that AFLP technique are a useful tool to measure genetic diversity in E. tangutorum, showing that geographical and environmental factors (especially precipitation) together, play a crucial role in genetic differentiation patterns. These findings underline the importance of local adaptation in shaping patterns of genetic variability and population structure in E. tangutorum germplasm collected in Western China.
              "	"                Elymus tangutorum              ;AFLPs;Genetic diversity;Geographic groups;Eco-environmental factors"	"Elymus Linn. is the largest and most widely distributed genus in the tribe Triticeae, with 150 species grown in temperate regions of the world [1]. This genus has a closer phylogenetic relationship with some of the important cereal crops, such as wheat, barley, rye and triticale [1]. Therefore, it may serve as a valuable natural gene pool of desirable traits for the improvement of these crops [2, 3]. Besides, many Elymus species are also used as fodder grasses and ecological protection [1]. Elymus tangutorum (Nevski) Hand.-Mazz, a perennial hexaploid species with the StYH genome (2nâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>6xâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>42), along with E. duhuricus Turcz. ex Griseb., E. excelsus Turcz. ex Griseb. and E. ivoroschilowii Probat. constitute the E. dahuricus complex [4, 5]. E. tangutorum differs morphologically from E. dahuricus Turcz. in the light of the short upward awns and its distribution in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), Xinjiang province of China and the Alpine regions of Central Asia. In QTP, E. tangutorum is widely used for the degraded grassland restoration, due to high productivity, drought resistance, cold tolerance, and adaptability [6]. As one of the more important forage grasses in QTP, E. tangutorum has been widely studied. Most of studies mainly focused on the domestication, cultivation, phylogenesis and genome constitution [4, 6].Understanding genetic diversity of wild plant germplasm and the relationships between ecogeographic and genetic characteristics may provide insights for better utilizing and conserving genetic resources [7]. Investigation of germplasm diversity can be implemented via morphological and molecular means. Previous analyses based on agro-morphological characters and geographical origin indicated that a wide range of phenotypic divergence occurred among Elymus accessions of ecotypes, and/or cultivars [8, 9]. DNA-based markers have been regarded as practical tools with high efficiency and wide genome coverage in illuminating the pattern of genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships in plant germplasm resources, with various advantages over phenotypic traits such as being not subject to environmental influences, potential of unlimited numbers, and assay from any development stage. In Elymus species, diverse PCR-based markers, employed in diversity and phylogeny studies, such as RAPD [10], ISSR [11], SRAP [12], ScoT [9, 13], and AFLP [14â<U+0080><U+0093>16] have become prevalent as any prior sequence information is not required. Among different marker systems available at present, AFLP method could explore variation throughout the entire genome, including both coding and non-coding DNA regions and may therefore genome-wide variation was allowed. Moreover, AFLP offers high reproducibility and multilocus polymorphisms simultaneously identified using a single assay. These characteristics make the AFLPs extremely appropriate for molecular characterization of germplasm collection. Although previous work has provided preliminary data to characterize genetic diversity between and within two E. tangutorum populations from Tibet province of China by AFLP analyses [4, 5], until today there is no detailed study has been conducted for molecular characterization using a larger germplasm collection.Genetic diversity in natural plant populations is held especially by the spatio-temporal environmental heterogeneity, i.e., genetic differentiation is strongly influenced through isolation by distance or local adaptation [17â<U+0080><U+0093>19]. To estimate the impact of environmental factors on the genetic diversity is indispensable to gain a deeper insight into such evolutionary forces [20â<U+0080><U+0093>22]. Thus, the combination analysis of molecular markers and eco-geographical data can provide beneficial information for taking up suitable strategies for utilization and conservation of wild plant germplasms [19, 23, 24].Here, AFLP markers were used to analyze, on a regional scale, genetic diversity and structure of 27 wild E. tangutorum germplasm accessions indigenous from two contrasting climatic zones of Western China, namely Qinghai-Tibet plateau and Xinjiang province (Fig. 1). The goals of the current study were (1) to evaluate and compare the genetic diversity and population structure of E. tangutorum germplasm from different areas, and (2) to verify the potential influence of spatial and environmental factors on the patterns of detected population structure.

Repressors are known from arthropods and vertebrates that differ strikingly by mode of action: whereas Drosophila Hairless assembles repressor complexes with CSL transcription factors, competition between activator and repressors occurs in vertebrates (for example SHARP/MINT and KyoT2). This divergence raises questions on the evolution: Are there common ancestors throughout the animal kingdom?              ;
                Results
                Available genome databases representing all animal clades were searched for homologues of Hairless, SHARP and KyoT2. The most distant species with convincing Hairless orthologs belong to Myriapoda, indicating its emergence after the Mandibulata-Chelicarata radiation about 500 million years ago. SHARP shares motifs with SPEN and SPENITO proteins, present throughout the animal kingdom. The CSL interacting domain of SHARP, however, is specific to vertebrates separated by roughly 600 million years of evolution. KyoT2 bears a C-terminal CSL interaction domain (CID), present only in placental mammals but highly diverged already in marsupials, suggesting introduction roughly 100 million years ago. Based on the LIM-domains that characterize KyoT2, homologues can be found in Drosophila melanogaster (Limpet) and Hydra vulgaris (Prickle 3 like). These lack the CID of KyoT2, however, contain a PET and additional LIM domains. Conservation of intron/exon boundaries underscores the phylogenetic relationship between KyoT2, Limpet and Prickle. Most strikingly, Limpet and Prickle proteins carry a tetra-peptide motif resembling that of several CSL interactors. Overall, KyoT2 may have evolved from prickle and Limpet to a Notch repressor in mammals.

                Conclusions
                Notch repressors appear to be specific to either chordates or arthropods. Orthologues of experimentally validated repressors were not found outside the phylogenetic group they have been originally identified. However, the data provide a hypothesis on the evolution of mammalian KyoT2 from Prickle like ancestors. The finding of a potential CSL interacting domain in Prickle homologues points to a novel, very ancestral CSL interactor present in the entire animal kingdom.
              "	"Notch repressors;Hairless;SHARP;KyoT2;Limpet;Prickle;Gene annotation;Evolution;Animal kingdom"	"The Notch signaling pathway                Multicellular organisms are built by a multitude of cell types that need to be determined and specified in the course of development. This often involves cell to cell communication mediated by the highly conserved Notch signaling pathway. The principal components, the receptor Notch and its ligands - for example Delta -, the signal transducing transcriptional regulator CSL (abbreviated from mammalian CBF1 or RBPJ, Drosophila Suppressor of Hairless and Caenorhabditis Lag1) as well as the HES (Hairy-Enhancer of split) class target-genes, are found in all higher eumetazoan genomes including Hydra vulgaris [1â<U+0080><U+0093>4].
                Notch signaling components have been first recognized in Drosophila melanogaster, where mutations in the genes encoding the receptor Notch, the ligands Delta and Serrate, as well as the major antagonist Hairless were identified around 100â<U+0080><U+0089>years ago [5â<U+0080><U+0093>7]. This is not surprising since all these genes are haplo-insufficient, i.e. mutants develop a dominant, name giving phenotype like wing incision, thickened wing veins or loss of mechano-sensory hairs and bristles. First indications that the genes are used in a common developmental process came from the manifold genetic interactions observed in mutant combinations [8]. Later molecular genetic studies revealed the nature of the respective proteins, and allowed to propose their respective roles in Notch signal transduction in flies, and similarly in many other species as well (reviewed in: [1, 2, 9]). In fact, there is a remarkably high conservation of the core components of the Notch signaling pathway in metaozoa throughout the animal kingdom [10].
              Activation of Notch signaling
                Simplified, Notch signaling activity is triggered by the binding of the membrane tethered ligand on one cell to the receptor Notch of the adjacent cell, resulting in the release of the Notch intra-cellular domain (NICD). NICD itself allows assembly of a transcription activator complex on Notch target gene promoters, together with CSL and the co-activator Mastermind (Mam) (Fig. 1a), as well as additional chromatin activators like histone acetyltransferase (p300, PCAF), histone demethylase (LSD1/CoREST) and histone ubiquitin-ligase (Bre1) (reviewed in: [11â<U+0080><U+0093>13]). CSL contains three conspicuous domains, a N-terminal domain NTD, a beta-trefoil domain BTD, and a C-terminal domain CTD (Fig. 1b). Whereas NTD and BTD make sequence-specific DNA-contacts, NICD contacts both BTD and CTD, the former with the so-called RAM (RBP-JÎº-associated molecule) domain, and the latter with the Ankyrin (ANK) repeats (Fig. 1b) (reviewed in: [11â<U+0080><U+0093>15]).

Red: branches with SHARP coding genes, blue: with Hairless coding genes
                      
                The activation process has been studied experimentally in several organisms, concentrating mostly on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the insect Drosophila melanogaster and several vertebrate species including Danio rerio (zebra fish), clawed frog Xenopus laevis, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens (reviewed in: [16]). Interestingly, the co-activator Mam shows little conservation [17]. Mam is part of the activator complex, contacting CSL and NICD with a bent alpha helix consisting of about 60 residues (Fig. 1a,b). Although Mam proteins are rather large, this alpha helix is the only common character between proteins from fly, worm and mammals (reviewed in: [11, 14, 17]). No sequences encoding a Mam-like protein were identified in the genome of the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris to date, including my own attempts. The few alignments not only lack an alpha helix, but also the conserved residues required for trimeric complex formation [18]. However, a Mam like gene it is present in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa) [10].
              Competition for the binding of CSLâ<U+0080><U+0099>s beta trefoil domain
                Whereas the principles of Notch target gene activation are well conserved, repression mechanisms are of bewildering variance, and have been primarily studied in mammals and Drosophila. CSL is central to Notch target gene regulation, be it activation or repression. Two principle mechanisms of repression apply (Fig. 1b) (reviewed in: [9, 13, 19]): Firstly, a competition of proteins with NICD for the binding of CSL, thereby decreasing availability of CSL for Notch and hence, activation levels of the target genes. Competition may be direct or indirect as outlined below. Secondly, assembly of a repressor complex on Notch target gene promoters, resulting in silencing of the target genes. Repressor complex formation involves CSL that hence can act as a molecular switch depending on the recruitment of co-activators versus co-repressors [19, 20]. In addition, recruitment of chromatin modifiers, notably histone deacetylases (HDACs, SMRT/Sin3A) and histone chaperones (e.g. Asf1), results in chromatin inactivation (reviewed in: [13]).
                The direct competition mechanism appears to be restricted to mammals. It specifically involves the RAM-BTD interaction (Fig. 1b): the RAM domain of NICD, including a tetra-peptide motif Î¦WÎ¦P (Î¦, any hydrophobic residue), makes hydrophobic contacts with a nonpolar pocket of the BTD (reviewed in: [12, 15]) (Fig. 1b, c). Several proteins have been identified to exploit this interaction site, including repressors of Notch activation and the EBNA2 (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2) viral activator hijacking the process [21â<U+0080><U+0093>25]. Structural analyses revealed stunning similarities between RAM and repressor binding; notably the tetra-peptide Î¦WÎ¦P specific contacts are highly conserved (Fig. 1c). Primary examples of CSL-repressor complexes include Mus musculus KyoT2 or Homo sapiens RITA (RBPJ interacting and tubulin associated) (Figs. 1b, c, 2) [19, 24, 25]. RITA is a small, tubulin-associated protein that not only competes with NICD for CSL binding, but results in CSL depletion by its nuclear export [26]. RITA is highly conserved in deuterostomes including Placozoa but, interestingly, not found in insects [26]. Because its evolution has been examined already, it was not included in this study. Despite the in vitro binding of human RITA to Drosophila melanogaster Su(H) and tubulin, no repression of Notch signaling activity was observed in vivo, indicating that this mechanism of Notch regulation does not apply to flies [27]. In contrast to RITA, little is known about the evolution of mouse KyoT2 (Fhl1C in human), one of three splice variants of KyoT (named also Fhl1, four and a half LIM domains). Each LIM domain comprises two tandemly repeated zinc finger domains, separated by a two-amino acid hydrophobic linker, thought to serve protein-protein interactions [28]. The KyoT2 splice variant is smaller, encoding just two and a half LIM domains followed by the CSL interacting domain (CID) encoded by the specific exon [21] (Fig. 2). Apart from the common tetra-peptide Î¦WÎ¦P motif, KyoT2 shares not structural similarity with RITA.

              Repressor complex formation on Notch target genes
                Repressor complex formation has been investigated both in vertebrates and Drosophila (Fig. 1d). It seems to be the primary mechanism of Notch target gene repression in flies, where it has been studied experimentally in detail. A major antagonist of Notch signaling in Drosophila melanogaster is named Hairless (H), which binds to the fly CSL ortholog Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] (Figs. 1a, 2a). By recruitment of the two general co-repressors Groucho (Gro) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), Hairless assembles a repressor complex on Notch-target gene promoters, thereby eventually silencing gene activity [29â<U+0080><U+0093>32] (reviewed in: [9]). The structure of the Su(H)-H repressor complex has been solved recently at the molecular level and confirmed experimentally in vivo [33]. Hairless binds to the CTD of Su(H) in a unconventional way: The Su(H) binding domain of Hairless forms beta-strands that slide deeply into the hydrophobic core of the CTD, distorting the structure in a way that excludes binding of Notch ANK domains [33] (Fig. 1b).
                Based on manifold genetic data revealing a quantitative antagonism between Notch and Hairless, a threshold model was postulated with Hairless competing with NICD for Su(H) binding in the cytoplasm [8, 34, 35]. As we know now, both Hairless and NICD bind Su(H) with similar affinities to form transcriptional repressor and activator complexes, respectively [33, 36, 37]. Moreover both, Hairless and NICD, are involved in nuclear shuttling of Su(H) [29, 38â<U+0080><U+0093>41]. Conservation of Hairless has been extensively studied (Fig. 1d): Orthologs are present in all insects studied to date as well as in some members of the subphylum Crustacea [9, 42â<U+0080><U+0093>44]. The D. melanogaster Hairless protein consists of 1077/1059 residues, however, is significantly smaller in more distant species like the honeybee Apis mellifera (392 aa) or the water flea Daphnia pulex (448 aa). Common to all Hairless orthologs is the Su(H) binding domain (SBD), that can be subdivided into a N-terminal NT and a C-terminal CT box, with the former being sufficient for Su(H) contacts (~â<U+0080><U+0089>37 residues). In addition, they all share the Gro binding domain GBD (~â<U+0080><U+0089>9 aa) and the CtBP binding domain CBD (~â<U+0080><U+0089>10 aa), as well as three potential nuclear localization signals (NLS) and one predicted nuclear export signal (NES) [37, 43â<U+0080><U+0093>45]. The three binding domains are well conserved, notably the NT box, which specifies Hairless orthologs (Fig. 2).
                Repressor complex formation in Homo sapiens involves SHARP (SMRT/HDAC1 associated repressor protein), also called MINT in Mus musculus (MSX-2 interacting nuclear target), suggested to be the functional homolog of Hairless [46â<U+0080><U+0093>48]. In contrast to the above repressors, SHARP not only binds to the BTD of CSL but also to the CTD, and recruits CtBP and CtIP as additional co-repressors to silence Notch target gene expression [48, 49]. The SHARP protein is very large (3664 amino acids in human) and contains four structural motifs, the RRM (RNA recognition motif) at the N-terminus and the SPOC (Spen paralog and ortholog C-terminal) domain at the C-terminus, the RID (receptor interacting domain) and the RBPJ interacting domain (RBP-ID) in the center (Fig. 2b). SHARP is also named SPEN after the D. melanogaster protein Split ends (Spen), which shares the RRM and SPOC domains, however, lacks the RID and RBP-ID of SHARP [50â<U+0080><U+0093>52]. Accordingly, both activating and repressive genetic interactions have been described between spen and members of the Notch pathway in the fly [53], but no direct physical protein interactions.
                Regarding KyoT2, experimental data on Notch repression have been gathered in addition to structural analyses of the repressor complex [21, 24]. Evolutionary data, however, are lacking so far.
                Taken all together, the knowledge on the negative regulation of Notch target genes is rather limited. It remains largely restricted to model systems, where Notch signaling has been studied experimentally, as well as to humans, where Notch regulation is of particular medical interest. And as outlined above, various mechanisms of regulation appear to exist in the animal kingdom used by some but not all clades. In the past years, sequence information for many more species has become available, allowing searches for possible repressor proteins outside of insects and vertebrates. Therefore, a search of the genome databases was performed, concentrating on the following questions: a) is there an evolutionary bond between the various repression mechanisms and b) are there homologues of the known repressors outside of arthropods or vertebrates?

              "	"Serum uric acid (SUA);Hyperuricemia (HUA);Gout;                SLC28A2              ;Polymorphisms"	"Gout is a metabolic disorder and manifests by a broad spectrum of clinical features including severe and episodic arthritis attack, chronic polyarthritis, palpable tophi and related kidney injuries, which are induced by elevated serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations and consequent deposition of supersaturated urate crystals. Uric acid (UA), the final metabolite of either dietary or endogenous purines, is much higher in humans than in other mammals due to the urate oxidase inactivity resulting from mutational silence during hominoid evolution [1] as well as the effective reabsorption mechanisms mediated by urate transporters expressed in kidney [2]. Thus, humans are more susceptible to exceed the reference range of SUA concentrations and suffer from HUA, defined as SUAâ<U+0080><U+0089>>â<U+0080><U+0089>420â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼mol/L in men and postmenopausal women or SUAâ<U+0080><U+0089>>â<U+0080><U+0089>360â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼mol/L in premenopausal women [3]. High SUA is the most causative factor of gout and the higher the SUA, the higher the gout incidence [4]. Besides, both HUA and gout always cluster with a variety of comorbidities including obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases [4, 5]. Due to the ever aging population worldwide, the changing of dietary structure and increased incidence of comorbidities etc., the prevalence of HUA and gout have been climbing dramatically and become major public healthcare issues [4].SUA and HUA are complex traits and disorders with individual heritability reaching up to 70% [6] and 60% [7], respectively. Gout shows evident aggregation within families and reported a heritability of 35.1% in men and 17.0% in women, indicating the importance of genetics as well [8]. Thus, detecting genetic determinants associated with SUA, HUA and gout is a key step in exploring the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of the related disorders. Extensive genetic studies, especially large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified dozens of susceptibility genes [4]. Despite, all these genetic determinants can only explain <â<U+0080><U+0089>10% variations for the disorders, indicating additional loci to be found [9].One-third of UA produced per day are acquired from dietary purines [10]. Thus, daily consumed food may affect the size of purines pool in the circulation and consequently cause UA overproduction. There have been multiple epidemiological investigations reporting that excessive consumption of purine-rich food was positively correlated with SUA level and gout incidence [11, 12]. Parallel, constraint of purine-rich food consumption was found to lower SUA level and alleviate gout flares [13]. Nucleosides absorption across luminal membrane of intestine into enterocytes is controlled by concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs), encoded by solute carrier (SLC) 28 family genes [14]. CNT2, encoded by the SLC28A2 gene, is expressed in luminal membrane of intestine and mediates efficient transport of dietary purine nucleosides and nucleoside analog ribavirin [14, 15]. Previously, a GWAS of SUA in a relatively isolated population of European descent from the Adriatic coast of Croatia identified the SLC28A2 gene to be suggestive in relation to SUA concentrations (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>5â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>10â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>6) [16]. In our previous GWAS with Han Chinese samples of clinically diagnosed gout patients and healthy individuals, we did not find significant associations between the SLC28A2 gene and gout at the discovery stage (PGWAS stageâ<U+0080><U+0089>>â<U+0080><U+0089>0.05) [17].The current study is designed to investigate relationships between SLC28A2 polymorphisms and SUA concentrations, HUA, as well as clinically ascertained gout in the Han Chinese population with additional sample sets. Then, by performing a meta-analysis combining results obtained in the present study and that acquired from our previous GWAS, we attempt to further examine the relationship between the SLC28A2 gene and gout."

                In this study, we constructed a ChIP-seq method that can be used to uncover the global binding sites by phiC31 integrase. 6740 potential Î¦C31 integrase binding sites were identified. A sequence motif was found that contains inverted repeats and has similarities to wild-type attP site. Using REPEATMASKER, we identified a total of 20,183 repeat-regions distributed in 50 repeat types for the 6740 binding sites. These sites enriched in â<U+0080><U+009C>regulation of GTPase activityâ<U+0080> of in the GO category of biological process and KEGG pathway of signal transmembrane transporter activity.

              "	"Î¦C31 integrase;Binding sites;ChIP-seq;Sequence motif"	"The Streptomyces phage Î¦C31 integrase is a site-specific recombinase that catalyzes recombination between two short DNA sequences, a bacterial attachment site (attB) and a phage attachment site (attP) [1]. As prokaryotic attachment sites, attP and attB are unlikely to occur in the genomes of mammals and most plants, but pseudo attP sites are present in the eukaryotic genome [2â<U+0080><U+0093>5], Î¦C31 integrase can efficiently target attB-bearing transgenes to endogenous pseudo attP sites within mammalian genomes [6, 7]. Because Î¦C31 integrase-mediated recombination is stable, irreversible and does not require external chemical energy and cofactors, Î¦C31 integrase has become a powerful tool for both gene therapy animals [8â<U+0080><U+0093>13] and generation of transgenic animals [14â<U+0080><U+0093>16]. However, with the use of Î¦C31 integrase system in genetic manipulations, an increasing number of problems is being encountered. On one hand, the presence of a large number of pseudo attP sites in the genome increases the risk of chromosomal rearrangements and DNA damage [17]. On the other hand, due to the high activity of the integrase system in the genome, the specificity does not appear to be as high as expected. Therefore, it is necessary to further study the mechanism of Î¦C31 integrase system in mammalian cells, in order to further optimize the system, improve its integration specificity and reduce the non-specific recombination.Studies on sequence characteristics of pseudo attP sites in many species revealed that sequence characteristic is one of the most important factors for Î¦C31 integrase to recognize the pseudo attP sites and mediate site-specific integration in eukaryotic cells [18â<U+0080><U+0093>21]. Meanwhile the pseudo attP sites in different cell types of the same species are cell-specific. For example, the BpsM1 site we found in bovine maden-darby bovine kidney (MDBK)cell line was not detected in bovine ear fibroblasts [18]. The 19q13.31 site in the human genome is detectable in all cell types, and 3q26.31 appears only in HepG2 cells [21]. These phenomena indicate that, in addition to sequence features, the recognition and binding of the integrase to the sites are also affected by other factors such as chromatin structure. However, this is still not fully studied and understood. The research on Î¦C31 integrase function in mammalian cells is still in its infancy. Indepth studies will accelerate its application in biological engineering. Especially, the main problems that need to be investigated include several aspects. First of all, although about 102â<U+0080><U+0093>103 pseudo attP sites have been predicted in mammalian cells [7], the actual number of potential sites we didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know. Thus the data on Î¦C31 integrase is too small to analyze its function and mechanism. Secondly, at present, common methods for identification of integration sites are plasmid rescue, reverse nested PCR and other methods. These methods have limitations and provide only a small amount of binding sites information.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) is a powerful tool for studying the interaction between protein and DNA in vivo. The ChIP-Seq technology, which combines ChIP with second-generation sequencing technology, can efficiently detect genome-wide DNA segments that interact with functional proteins [22].In this study we establish an expression platform for Î¦C31 integrase in bovine cells and identify the whole set of Î¦C31 integrase binding sites in these cells by using ChIP-Seq technology. We equally aimed to analyze the characteristics of these binding sites using bioinformatics."

              "	"Hulless barleyÂ·genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS);Purple seed coat color (Psc);Linkage analysis"	"Hulless barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum Hook. f.) is a self-reproducing annual species that produces naked grains. Hulless barley is widely grown on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It has served as a staple food for the Tibetan people since the fifth century CE [1]. The seed coat color is an important agronomic trait in crops due to its association with unique biological activity and function in healthcare [2]. Upon maturity, barley grains may display different pigmentations. Barley has a variety of seed coat colors, including yellow, blue, purple, and black [3]. The use of colored grains in cereal-based functional foods has been considered based on their high levels of natural antioxidants such as phenolic compounds, anthocyanins and essential amino acids [4]. Colored barley varieties have been found to be more suitable for health than the standard (yellow) variety because these produce pearling fractions that are rich in bioactive compounds [5]. The development of barley flour, which itself has antioxidant properties, is used in various mainstream foods such as breads, muffins, noodles, and pasta [6]. The breeding of colored barley varieties has become an increasingly pertinent issue in agriculture in recent years.Seed coat color is thought to be associated with the synthesis of anthocyanins, which are flavonoids present in plants [7]. The yellow color of barley is attributed to proanthocyanidins synthesized in the seed coat (testa layer) [8]. The purple color is associated with anthocyanins synthesized in the pericarp and glumes [9]. In barley, a number of mutants that lack anthocyanins or proanthocyanidins (designated ant mutants) have been documented. The Ant loci, known as anthocyanin or proanthocyanidin synthesis genes, are classified as Ant1 to Ant30 [10]. Flavonoid biosynthesis and the associated metabolic pathways have been studied in barley [11]. Also some candidate genes have been identified. Ant1 (HvC1), which is located on chromosome 7H, reduces stem anthocyanin content [12]. Ant2 (HvbHLH1), which is located on chromosome 2HL, regulates anthocyanin pigmentation in the auricles, awns, and lemmata. It is not involved, however, in grain proanthocyanidin pigmentation in grains [13]. Ant17 (flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3H), which is located on chromosome 2HL, has been observed in pigmented tissues. It is not found in nonpigmented roots and stems [14]. Ant18 (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; DFR), which is located on chromosome 3HL, is involved in both proanthocyanidin and anthocyanin synthesis [14, 15]. Ant28 (Hvmyb10), which is located on chromosome 3HL, specifically regulates proanthocyanidin synthesis for grain color and dormancy [10]. Although these genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins in barley have been identified, their association with seed color in hulless barley remains unclear.Major obstacles to traditional methods for marker development include low efficiency and high cost of generating high-density genetic linkage maps [16]. High-throughput sequencing technology has enabled the determination of hulless barley genome sequences [17]. Therefore, accelerating the process and efficiency of molecular marker-assisted breeding in this plant species is important. A high-density genetic map is a valuable tool in genomic and genetic applications and especially in fine mapping [18, 19]. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), a simple and relatively inexpensive procedure, has reduced the complexity of mapping because it is particularly suitable for a large number of samples in genetic map construction [20â<U+0080><U+0093>22]. Recent advances in GBS technology have allowed the identification of numerous genetic molecular markers at a reasonable cost. This has promoted the development of several high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping methods [23].The present study generated a large double haploid (DH) population from a cross between the Nierumuzha and Kunlun10. The seed coat of Kunlun10 is yellow and that of Nierumuzha is deep purple. Dense marker data was obtained for 298 DH individuals using the GBS technology. We identified 3662 efficient SNP markers, which were ultimately refined into 1129 bin markers after screening. The seed coat color of individual plants was determined. This information was used to map the Psc of hulless barley. The candidate genes and significant loci detected in this study suggested that our approach is cost-effective for fine mapping and can identify rapidly other key phenotypic genes in hulless barley."

The pollutants have been detected in the coastal regions of South Korea [3, 4]. They have been causing increasing concerns to aquatic environment due to difficulty in biodegradation and potentials of bioaccumulation and biomagnification to higher trophic levels via food web [5]. Cd, a non-essential metal has been reported to adversely affect the physiology and biochemistry of aquatic invertebrates [6, 7]. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), PAH representative, adversely affects survival inhibition [8], growth inhibition [9], behavior impairment [10], and reproduction problems [11] of aquatic organisms. Since the sensitivity of signal pathway and subsequent detoxification cascade are very different for chemicals, we assume that transcriptome can differentially respond to certain chemical through specific and/or common responsive metabolism. Thus, we employed two distinct chemicals to detect early molecular markers and to validate whether the application of transcriptome profiling of brackish water flea is useful method for environmental risk assessment. Understanding the molecular effects of these pollutants may provide an alternative method to predict their toxicities.Cladocera (crustacean) are filter-feeding planktonic water flea. Daphnia species have been extensively used due to their versatility as model animals for acute and/or chronic toxicity test and ecotoxicological application. Aquatic ecotoxicological studies mostly focus on freshwater Daphnia species such as D. magna or D. pulex (Crustacea, Cladocera, Daphniidae), while brackish water fleas are used sparingly. One of the advantages of freshwater Daphnia species is the availability of whole genome information and subsequent functional genomics application [12, 13]. There have been extensive transcriptome and genome studies on freshwater Daphnia species in the past decade. Estuaries and coastal regions are also important sites of ecotoxicology, with various land-derived contaminants. Sentinel organisms are useful for risk assessment and to ensuring safe and habitable environment in aquatic ecosystems. Thus, there is a need to develop robust model species for marine ecotoxicological research.In general, most cladoceran appear to be restricted to freshwater, while Diaphanosoma celebensis (Crustacea, Cladocera, Sididae), is a euryhaline brackish water flea species distributes in tropical Asia [14]. In aquaculture industry, there is a need for developing tolerant or adapted cladoceran upon a wide range of salinity that can be applied from small aquaria to large-scale mass culture system under seawater condition. Changes in salinity have been considered as one of the crucial stressors, as even small change can directly affect osmoregulation and physiological homeostasis of marine animals. Since most aquaculture and fishery systems are located within coastal regions where the ultimate freshwater are released from inland, development of a species, which can maintain biological activity against steep salinity change, is important in aquaculture industry. They have been mainly studied in the field of aquaculture as a substitute live food [15, 16]. D. celebensis are primary consumers and are important for energy transfer to higher trophic levels in the aquatic food web.D. celebensis, like freshwater Daphnia species, can be easily raised under laboratory culture conditions and require similar conditions with respect to feeding, water quality (pH), and light cycles, except for salinity and temperature. Furthermore, small size (adult 413â<U+0080><U+0093>1112â<U+0080><U+0089>Î¼m), parthenogenetic mode of reproduction, short generation time (4â<U+0080><U+0093>5â<U+0080><U+0089>days), and easy maintenance in laboratory makes them suitable test organisms for marine ecotoxicological studies [17]. Genomics resource is very important for development of reliable model animal. Even though reference genomic database is absent in almost non-model animals, next generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with de novo assembly and appropriate bioinformatics tools enable us to use high quality genomic resource of certain animal.Here, we developed a new transcriptomic resource of the brackish water flea D. celebensis using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform and bioinformatics tools. To develop D. celebensis as a promising model animal for ecotoxicogenomics, following exposure to Cd and BaP, we analyzed the transcriptome and compared differentially expressed transcripts. The genomic information of D. celebensis will allow future investigation of molecular ecotoxicological pathways, with a particular focus on monitoring estuaries and coastal regions."

In China, there are four unique populations: Bletilla striata, Bletilla formosana, Bletilla ochracea and Bletilla sinensis [20]. Traditional Chinese Medicine holds that Bletilla striata is capable of restraining blood leakage, stopping bleeding, dispersing swelling and promoting tissue regeneration. Thus it could be effectively applied in the treatment of hematemesis, hemoptysis, traumatic bleeding, chapped kin, and ulcerative carbuncle [4, 17]. Besides, Bletilla striata can be added in medicated diets or drinks when stewed together with chicken or duck and extracted by boiling water or brewed as wine material [14]. Additionally, the non-medical uses of Bletilla striata include rubbing its mucilaginous roots in inkstones with vermilion for writing [7], and another use is as an insecticide [12]. In industry, Bletilla extract is used as a coating agent and cosmetic additive [14]. Moreover, the plant also has very high decorative value [14]. The wide uses of Bletilla striata results in demand exceeding supply.In China, the natural resources of Bletilla striata have been severely damaged because of the excessive exploitation and destruction of natural habitats [14]. More than 10 years ago, Bletilla striata was listed as one of the key protected wild medicinal plants (http://rep.iplant.cn/). The price of Bletilla striata has soared 20-fold in the past 10 years [14]. In order to solve the problem of Bletilla striata resources, the artificial cultivation of Bletilla striata and its related species has been developed in the majority of regions in China [9]. More importantly, research on strengthening the selection and breeding of excellent varieties of Bletilla striata also has been launched [22]. As part of the efforts to protect the precious plant and explore the best way to utilize the entire plant, our laboratory established good practice for the genetic relationships of Bletilla until now.Molecular markers are one of the most important methods to allow cultivar identification. They are widespread used on account of their simple operation and high detection efficiency [8]. The different DNA-based molecular markers unfold plant variability directly at genetic levels with reliable data required for the estimation of genetic diversity [2], such as inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP), or start codon targeted (SCoT) polymorphism [13].

                we constructed and transformed a RNA interference expression vector of TaCKX2.4 in bread wheat line NB1. Southern blotting analysis was used to select transgenic plants with single copy. The expression of TaCKX2.4 gene was estimated by Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Finally, the relation between expression of TaCKX2.4 gene and grain numbers was validated.

                Totally, 20 positive independent events were obtained. Homozygous lines from 5 events with a single copy of transformed gene each were selected to evaluate the expression of TaCKX2.4 and grain numbers per spike in T3 generation. Compared with the control NB1, the average grain numbers per spike significantly increased by 12.6%, 8.3%, 6.5% and 5.8% in the T3 lines JW39-3A, JW1-2B, JW1-1A and JW5-1A, respectively.

              "	"The plant hormone cytokinin (CK) promotes cell proliferation and differentiation, and regulates plant growth and development from many processes, such as senescence, shoot and root balance, transduction of nutritional signals, leaf senescence, chloroplast formation and crop productivity [1–3]. CK in grains during the early stage of grain development play an important role in regulating grain filling pattern and consequently influence grain filling percentage [4], and CK in the grains may mediate cell division in rice endosperm at early grain filling stages [5]. CK are the most potent general coordinator between the stay-green trait and senescence. Stay-green can not only increase the yield of wheat but also its resistance to heat stress during active photosynthesis [6]. Exogenous cytokinins can sustain longer active photosynthetic period during the grain filling stage, transfer more assimilates to the grain [7], and increase grain yield under heat stress [6]. The increase of photosynthetic productivity can lead to high yields through improvement of leaf anatomical and biochemical traits including tolerance to non-optimal temperature conditions [8].Cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases (CKX) are important in controlling local cytokinin levels and contribute to the regulation of cytokinin-dependent processes [9]. CKX is regarded as a negative regulator of cytokinin [10]. Overexpression of CKX gene led to reduced endogenous cytokinin contents in plants [11].A number of CKX genes were cloned from Zea mays [12], Arabidopsis [13], orchid [14], rice [15], barley and wheat [16–20]. The functions of CKX genes were demonstrated in some plants by transgenic technology. The relationship between CKX and CK has been extensively investigated to understand their functions in plant development. The CKX activity may be induced by the levels of CK [20]. In Arabidopsis, the transgenic plants with an overexpression of AtCKX1 and AtCKX3 had fewer flowers on each inflorescence stem, indicating a reduction in the ability of apical inflorescence meristems to form new flower primordia [13]. In rice, the transgenic plants with low expression level of OsCKX2 had an increased grain numbers, whereas the transgenic plants with a higher expression level of OsCKX2 showed a lower grain numbers. In addition, an OsCKX2 null variety had high grain yield [15]. This suggested that the different transcript levels of OsCKX2 were responsible for the phenotypic differences of these rice varieties [15]. Down-regulation of OsCKX2 expression increased tiller numbers and improved grain weight [21]. Overexpression or suppression of GhCKX (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in transgenic tobacco led to deficiency of cytokinin (e.g., fewer or no flowers) or over-production of cytokinin (e.g., more flowers and capsules) [19]. In addition, silencing of HvCKX1 in transgenic barley resulted in a lower CKX activity and a higher grain yield [17]. So far, there have been no reports of transgenic wheat to prove the function of TaCKX gene.Wheat is one of the most important staple crops worldwide. To study the relationship between the expression level of CKX and wheat productivity, Zhang et al. [19] cloned TaCKX6 and observed that its haplotype variants were significantly associated with the 1000-grain weight based on linkage mapping, association study and gene expression analysis. The expression level of two TaCKX2 genes was significantly correlated with grain numbers per spike [18]. However, the relationship between the CKX gene expression and number of reproductive organs in transgenic plants remains unknown. In the present study, a TaCKX2.4 [22] RNA interference vector (piCKX2.4) was constructed and transformed into immature embryos using the seed inoculation method to validate the function of TaCKX2.4 and the relationship between TaCKX2.4 and grain numbers in bread wheat."

One possible reason is the limited ability to detect disease causal structural variants (SVs) from short reads sequencing technologies. Long reads sequencing can produce longer reads (typically 1000 bp or longer), therefore offering greatly improved ability to detect SVs that may be missed by short-read sequencing.              ;
                Results
                Here we describe a case study, where WES identified only one heterozygous pathogenic variant for an individual suspected to have glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia), which is an autosomal recessive disease caused by bi-allelic mutations in the G6PC gene. Through Nanopore long-read whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 7.1 kb deletion covering two exons on the other allele, suggesting that complex structural variants (SVs) may explain a fraction of cases when the second pathogenic allele is missing from WES on recessive diseases. Both breakpoints of the deletion are within Alu elements, and we designed Sanger sequencing and quantitative PCR assays based on the breakpoints for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for the family planning on another child. Four embryos were obtained after in vitro fertilization (IVF), and an embryo without deletion in G6PC was transplanted after PGD and was confirmed by prenatal diagnosis, postnatal diagnosis, and subsequent lack of disease symptoms after birth.
              ;
                Conclusions
                In summary, we present one of the first examples of using long-read sequencing to identify causal yet complex SVs in exome-negative patients, which subsequently enabled successful personalized PGD.
              "	"Whole-exome sequencing;WES;Structural variants;Long-read sequencing;G6PC;PGD;GSD-Ia"	"Whole exome sequencing (WES) is now widely used in genetic testing on patients who are suspected or have been clinically demonstrated to have genetic disorders. However, a large proportion (~â<U+0080><U+0089>60â<U+0080><U+0093>70%) of patients judged clinically to have a Mendelian disease receive negative results on WES with current Illumina short-read sequencing technology [1â<U+0080><U+0093>5]. Compared to WES, the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) does not appear to significantly improve the diagnostic yield [6, 7] or present much economic advantage [8]. Therefore, WES/WGS-negative cases pose a significant challenge to the clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases. Several reasons may explain the lack of positive findings, such as the inefficiency of template DNA capture, the biases in sequencing coverage, the failure to call causal variants from data, the inability to catalog all functional variants (especially non-coding variants), the incorrect clinical interpretation of genetic variants, the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease in certain patients and the possibility of disease causal mechanisms due to somatic or epigenetic origin. Among these reasons, the limited ability to interrogate repeat elements such as tandem repeats [9] and structural variants (SVs) [10] may play important roles. Clinical microarrays such as SNP arrays or array-CGH can detect relatively large deletions and duplications [11â<U+0080><U+0093>14], but have difficulty to reliably identify small (<â<U+0080><U+0089>10 kb) exonic deletions or complex SVs in clinical settings [15]. Furthermore, several published studies demonstrated examples where disease causal SVs were missed by short-read WES/WGS [16], or that certain classes of disease causal repeats failed to be identified by WES/WGS [17]. In particular, conventional short-reads sequencing approaches have been reported to lack sensitivity, exhibit very high false positive rate, and misinterpret complex or nested SVs [18].Long-read sequencing technologies, such as the 10X Genomics linked-read sequencing, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and PacBio single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, offer complementary strengths to traditional WES/WGS based on short-read sequencing. Long-read sequencing can produce read length (typically 1000 bp or longer) that is far higher than the 100-150 bp produced by short-read sequencing, therefore allowing for the resolution of breakpoints of complex SVs [19] or the detection of long tandem repeats [20, 21]. In particular, recent de novo human genome assemblies via long-read sequencing have revealed tens of thousands of SVs per genome, several times more than previously observed via WGS, suggesting an underestimation of the extent and complexity of SVs [22â<U+0080><U+0093>25].In the present study, we applied a long-read whole-genome sequencing to yield the genetic diagnosis of glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) in a patient whose causal variants were unsolved by Sanger sequencing and WES. Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD-I) is a group of autosomal recessive metabolic diseases caused by defects in the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) complex, with an overall incidence of approximately 1:20,000â<U+0080><U+0093>40,000 cases per live birth [26, 27]. The most common form, GSD-Ia, represents more than 80% of GSD-I cases [28]. Mutations in the G6PC gene have been found to be the cause of this disease. The G6PC comprises of five exons on chromosome 17q21, and encodes a 35 kD monomeric protein, the G6Pase catalytic subunit, which plays a role in the endoplasmic reticulum [29, 30]. Through Sanger sequencing and WES, we were able to identify one deleterious mutation in the proband, yet we suspected the presence of a complex SV due to the observation of Mendelian inconsistency in the family. As a result of long-read sequencing, we made a positive diagnosis of GSD-Ia on the patient and accurately identified the breakpoints of a causal SV in the other allele of the G6PC gene, which further guided genetic counseling in the family and enabled a successful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for in vitro fertilization (IVF) on the family."

                Analysis of variance, divesity examination and Mantel correlation test detected a significant effect of latitude on morphological traits. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis clearly separated the selected populations into four groups according to latitude. Larger morphological sizes of C. dactylon appeared at the low- and high-latitude regions. Correlation analysis indicated that high morphological variations were significantly correlated with climate factors and soil nutrient.

              "	"                Cynodon dactylon              ;Morphology;Variation;Latitude;Soil nutrient"	"Morphological plasticity may be of critical importance for resource acquisition by plants [1]. They change their growth form to become more flexible in favorable habitat. The morphological and developmental diversity between taxa and within each taxon is vast. Phenotypic variation observed for plants is generally a response to differences in climatic conditions that reflects adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity [2â<U+0080><U+0093>6]. The Cynodon species is enormously variable and has become truly cosmopolitan which is originated and diversified somewhere from West Pakistan to Turkey(i.e., Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and the West part of Pakistan) and distributed in all countries and islands between about lat 45Â°N and lat 45Â°S and penetrates to approximately lat 53Â°N in Europe. Perennial Bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] of the tribe Chlorideae (Poaceae) is a genetically and morphologically diverse warm-season grass widely used for pasture, forage, turf grass, soil stabilization, and remediation [7, 8]. Over the past decades, several studies have examined morphology, physiology, and biochemistry in order to assess the diversity of C. dactylon [9â<U+0080><U+0093>12]. There is enormous morphological variability among the nine recognized Cynodon species [13]. Australia is third to Africa and Asia respectively in terms of Cynodon species diversity and seven Cynodon species currently were recognized in the Australian Biological Resources Study [14, 15]. Bermudagrass is widespread in Italy under different ecological situations, and there was wide variation in wild populations concerning morphological traits of potential interest for turf use, such as leaf size and growth habit [16].Geographical or environmental gradient exerts the strongest adaptive selection on some related variation both in genetic structure and phenotypic traits of a species. Many of these factors include temperature, precipitation, soil nutrient availability, growing season length, photoperiod and biotic agents are directly affected by geographic position or elevation, and are therefore interrelated. Such latitudinal gradients in species richness are among the most universal features of nature and have been discussed by many authors [17, 18]. Changes in latitude have a drastic effect on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil and hence change the quality of soil. Regeneration and growth of vegetation occurred successfully are affected by a variety of conditions of soil [19]. It is well known that N transformations are affected by a number of soil properties, including mineralogy and texture, organic matter quantity and quality, pH, moisture, and microbial population size [20], and these soil properties can vary considerably from one turfgrass system to another [21, 22]. Soil organic matter is an important component of soil, and microbial biomass is the living and active part of the soil organic matter, the source and sink of available nutrients, builds up with increased accumulation of organic matter during soil development [23â<U+0080><U+0093>26] . Some types of reactive N (e.g., NH4+ and NO3â<U+0088><U+0092>) are essential to plant growth and ecosystem productivity. Due to the direct relationship between soil nutrients and quality, it is closely linked to the primary productivity of the ecosystem [27], and responsible for the nutrient cycling and development and function of the soil system [28, 29]. Latitudinally-defined climate conditions may provide specific Cynodon types and soil environments. The optimal resolution at which soil and Cynodon variables should be sensed and treated is not well defined. Scientific information on the variability and distribution of soil properties is critical for understanding ecosystem processes and making sustain-able soil, crop, and environmental management decisions [30, 31]. Strategic sampling of Cynodon at simply different latitude has not been conducted in China and the collection is expected to include valuable germplasm for Cynodon improvement and research. The objectives of this study were: (1) to examine morphological variability of Cynodon along latitude gradient; (2) to determine if and how differences in morphological traits of Cynodon were correlated with climate factors and soil nutrient. This information will facilitate the future use of germplasm in Cynodon breeding, genomics, conservation, taxonomy, and phylogeographical research and evaluate accurately whether natural selection and migration may allow evolutionary responses for populations to sufficiently match their new climates."

Although microsatellite loci for the species have been identified from populations in southwestern China, amplification of those markers for Korean populations have been unsuccessful. The complicated taxonomy of Korean striped field mouse including populations on Jeju Island (A. a chejuensis) necessitates identification of additional molecular markers.              ;

The genome sequencing of these species allows for gene discovery with an eye towards discerning the natural variability available for future breeding. The Q-type C2H2 zinc-finger protein (ZFP) transcription factors contain zinc finger motifs with a conserved QALGGH as part of the motif and they may play a critical role in the plants response to stress. While they may contain from one to five ZF domains (ZFD) this work focuses on the ZFPs that contain two zinc-fingers, which bind to the promoter of genes, and negatively regulate transcription via the EAR motif. B. oleracea and rapa are diploid and evolved into distinct species about 3.7 million years ago. B. napus is polyploid and formed by fusion of the diploids about 7500 years ago.              ;
                Results
                This work identifies a total of 146 Q-type C2H2-ZFPs with 37 in B. oleracea, 35 in B. rapa and 74 in B. napus. The level of sequence similarity and arrangement of these genes on their chromosomes have mostly remained intact in B. napus, when compared to the chromosomes inherited from either B. rapa or oleracea. In contrast, the difference between the protein sequences of the orthologs of B. rapa and oleracea is greater and their organization on the chromosomes is much more divergent. In general, the 146 proteins are highly conserved especially within the known motifs. Differences within subgroups of ZFPs were identified. Considering that B. napus has twice the number of these proteins in its genome, RNA-Seq data was mined and the expression of 68 of the 74 genes was confirmed.
              ;
                Conclusion
                Alignment of these proteins gives a snapshot of the variability that may be available naturally in Brassica species. The aim is to study how different ZFPs bind different genes or how dissimilar EAR motifs alter the negative regulation of the genes bound to the ZFP. Results from such studies could be used to enhance tolerance in future Brassica breeding programs.
              "	"Brassica;Q-type C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors;Cabbage;Canola"	"Q-type C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFP) are transcription factors. â<U+0080><U+009C>Q-typeâ<U+0080> refers to the invariant QALGGH sequence found in the zinc finger domains, and C2H2 characterizes the two cysteine and two histidine residues found in each finger. These residues bind a zinc ion that stabilizes the ZFP and allows binding specificity to a domain within the promoter of the gene it regulates. First discovered in petunia by Takatsuji et al. [1], a total of 21 Q-type C2H2 ZFPs have been described in that species [2]. Using in silico methods, Englbrecht et al. [3] described 3 groups of ZFPs in Arabidopsis; A, B and C, with the C family divided into three additional groups (C1, C2 and C3) depending on the number of spaces between the invariant histidines. There are 64 members in the C1 family that contain either a single or a cluster of two to five zinc finger domains (ZFDs). The C1 family has three amino acids between the histidines and contains many proteins responsive to environmental stress [4, 5]. In Arabidopsis, the 18 two fingered Q-type C2H2 ZFP proteins are members of the C1-2i and here will be referred to as ZFPs. The Arabidopsis proteins cluster into five groups named 2i-A-D with an outlier-X [3]. These ZFPs include a conserved domain containing the amino acids DLN. It is similar to the first active repression motif described in plants [6], which was named the ethylene-responsive element-binding factor (ERF)-associated amphiphilic repression (or EAR) domain. A role for the EAR motif as an active repressor was also demonstrated in ZFPs of Arabidopsis [7]. Ectopic expression of ZFPs can lead to an increase in tolerance to specific stresses [5]. Subsequently additional studies identifying all forms of C2H2 ZFPs have been undertaken in for example rice, foxtail millet, poplar and crocus [8â<U+0080><U+0093>11]. Several other studies focused specifically on the Q-type C2H2 TFs, for example in poplar, or bread wheat [12, 13]. Generally, these studies utilize the availability of a published genome sequence, however, studies in bread wheat (a hexaploid organism) and crocus relied on ESTs from public databases [11, 13]. The work described in this manuscript, catalogs the Q-type ZFPs in three Brassica species. Therefore, naturally occurring variants within these proteins can be utilized in subsequent studies to identify how the altered sequences could affect gene expression. ZFPs might be useful as tools for breeding increased tolerance to biotic or abiotic stresses encountered by cole crops.In the current study, we identify ZFPs of economically important Brassica species, and analyze their structure and their expression using RNA-Seq data from previously published work. To cast a wide net for capturing genetically related ZFPs, three related species were examined and compared to Arabidopsis ZFPs. Arabidopsis is also a member of the Brassicaceae and evolved from the same ancestral progenitor as the Brassica species. The Arabidopsis lineage split from this ancestral progenitor approximately 20 million years ago (mya) with a whole genome duplication occurring in the Brassica lineage ~â<U+0080><U+0089>16 mya, which is reflected in a doubling in gene number when comparing Brassica to Arabidopsis [14]. Comparative mapping of Arabidopsis to several other similar species provides evidence for an ancestral Arabidopsis genome that has been divided into 24 blocks [15]. These have been reshuffled in present day Arabidopsis and these syntenic blocks have also been identified in modern Brassica species. Maps showing the reorganization of these blocks in B. rapa and B. oleracea have been published along with the genome sequences of these species [16, 17]. The blocks are not collinear in B. oleracea and B. rapa but have a different organizational pattern, probably due to chromosomal translocations during the time since these species split from their shared ancestor, about 3.7 mya [14]. These species are diploid, containing 9 and 10 chromosomes, respectively. Their genomes fused and duplicated to form B. napus ~â<U+0080><U+0089>7500 years ago [18]. Brassica species therefore are both diploid and polyploid. The triangle of U [19] represents their evolution with the diploid species B. rapa, nigra and oleracea at the points of the triangle containing genomes A, B and C respectively. Between the tips of the triangle are the polyploid species with B. napus along the side of the triangle between B. rapa and B. oleracea containing both A and C genomes, respectively. Since B. rapa contains 10 chromosomes and B. oleracea contains 9 chromosomes the B. napus genome still maintains 19 chromosomes. Indeed, the 19 B. napus chromosomes are labeled chromosome A1-A10 and C01-C09, reflecting the genomes from which they were derived. These species include many important oil and vegetable crops; such as broccoli, cabbage, Chinese cabbage and canola. Given the evolution of these crops, the comparison of the Q-type ZFPs in the three reference genomes should provide a picture of the genetic diversity available for testing the effects of different ZFPs on the biotic stress response in these species. Since this group of Q-type ZFPs have previously been associated with regulating environmental stress and can enhance tolerance to the stress [5], identification of these proteins in the commercially important Brassica species may lead to their use in breeding programs. This work identified 146 ZFPs in three Brassica species. Prior studies analyzing the ZFDs and EAR motifs mutated one protein at a time and demonstrated how this altered either DNA binding for the ZFDs or negative regulation with the modified EAR motif [2, 4, 5]. The study documented here begins to address how much variation in these motifs can occur naturally."

In Drosophila melanogaster, the ATR homologue meiotic 41 (mei-41) is pivotal to DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint signalling. Although various mei-41 mutant alleles have been analyzed in the past, no gain-of-function allele is yet available. To fill this gap, we have generated transgenic flies allowing temporal and tissue-specific induction of mei-41.              ;
                Results
                Overexpression of mei-41 in wing and eye anlagen affects proliferation and a G2/M checkpoint even in the absence of genomic stress. Similar consequences were observed following the overexpression of the downstream kinase Grapes (Grp) but not of Loki (Lok), encoding the respective Drosophila Chk1 and Chk2 homologues, in agreement with their previously reported activities. Moreover, we show that irradiation induced cell cycle arrest was prolonged in the presence of ectopic mei-41 expression. Similar to irradiation stress, mei-41 triggered the occurrence of a slower migrating form of Grp, implying specific phosphorylation of Grp in response to either signal. Using a p53R-GFP biosensor, we further show that overexpression of mei-41 was sufficient to elicit a robust p53 activation in vivo.

                Conclusion
                We conclude that overexpression of the Drosophila ATR homologue mei-41 elicits an effectual DNA damage response irrespective of irradiation.
              "	"ATR;DNA damage checkpoint;Mei-41;Overexpression;p53 activation"	"Environmental and intrinsic stressors may impact the integrity of genome, i.e. the DNA, thereby provoking mutations eventually leading to cellular transformation or cell death. DNA damage is combated by a complex interplay of repair mechanisms ensuring the stability of the genome. Studies on DNA damage response (DDR) in a large variety of organisms, be it single cells like yeast or multicellular organisms like Drosophila or mammals, revealed that all organisms have evolved a core of components strikingly conserved across eukaryotes (reviewed in [1–3]). DDR can be envisaged as a cascade of signalling events, starting with the recognition of DNA lesions followed by the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway to cause a temporarily cell cycle arrest thus enabling DNA repair processes to occur (reviewed in [1, 4]). Typical of signalling cascades, DDR is regulated by phosphorylation events mediated by different kinases all belonging to the conserved phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related protein kinase (PIKK) superfamily (reviewed in [5, 6]). These kinases transmit the signals from the site of DNA damage to the cell cycle machinery by activating cell cycle checkpoints. The G2/M DNA damage checkpoint is critical for the maintenance of genome stability as unrepaired DNA double strand breaks (DSB) may directly cause mistakes in chromosomal segregation to the daughter cells if ending up in the M phase of the cell cycle. Hence, the final exit strategy in multicellular organisms before cellular transformation, and eventually cancer occurs as consequence of DDR is cellular suicide, i.e. apoptosis (reviewed in [7, 8]).The Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases are the central mediators of DDR (reviewed in [5, 6]). ATM is known to orchestrate a global response to DSB in higher organisms including DNA repair, checkpoint activation and apoptosis. Well characterized targets of ATM are the Chk2 kinase and the tumour suppressor p53, the latter being stabilized upon DNA damage to further initiate specific target gene expression executing cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis, respectively (reviewed in [1, 9]). Whereas ATM is involved primarily in the mammalian DSB response, ATR is activated by a much wider range of genotoxic stresses and appears to be a much more important player in DDR of yeast cells than ATM (reviewed in [2, 6]). Once activated, ATR phosphorylates and activates the protein kinase Chk1, which effects a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition, allowing more time for DNA repair so that cells do not enter mitosis prematurely. Noteworthy, there is considerable crosstalk between the ATM/ATR signal transduction pathways (reviewed in [6, 8]).The Drosophila homologue of ATM is called telomere fusion (tefu), as it was originally identified by its essential role in telomere maintenance [10]. Although tefu is important for p53 activation and DNA damage-induced apoptosis, it has no evident role in cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage [10–14]. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila Chk2 homologue loki (lok) regulates p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage as well as to telomere loss [15–21]. The ATR homologue in Drosophila is encoded by meiotic 41 (mei-41). Mutational analyses revealed that mei-41 is indispensable for meiotic recombination checkpoints as well as for DNA damage checkpoints in somatic cells [13, 22–27]. Like its target kinase grapes (grp) (the Drosophila Chk1 homologue), mei-41 is important to postpone the mitosis entry in larval cells after IR-stress [24, 25, 28]. Moreover, mei-41 and grp mutant flies are highly sensitive towards triggers that damage DNA or inhibit DNA replication, and are therefore essential to maintain genomic and chromosomal stability [29–33]. Overall in Drosophila, mei-41 appears to mostly fulfil the roles of both ATM and ATR with regard to DDR, whereas tefu’s primary role is the maintenance of telomeres and triggering apoptosis.Although various mei-41 mutant alleles have been analyzed in the past in Drosophila, no gain-of-function allele is yet available. In order to fill this gap, we generated a mei-41 construct under UAS-control, which allows temporal and tissue-specific expression of mei-41 with the help of the versatile Gal4/UAS system [34]. We show that the overexpression of mei-41 in imaginal tissues is sufficient to induce a G2 arrest constraining the growth of affected tissues. Moreover, in the presence of ectopic Mei-41 cells are hampered to resume the cell cycle after irradiation (IR)-mediated arrest. Upon IR-stress, Grp protein shows retarded mobility, and likewise upon mei-41 overexpression, suggesting that ectopic Mei-41 protein is sufficient to phosphorylate Grp protein. Finally, using a p53-biosensor we show that overexpression of mei-41 effects p53 reporter gene expression in vivo, suggesting a link to the Chk2/lok pathway as well. Overall, our data provide evidence for a mei-41-induced cellular response independent of DDR-mediated mei-41 activation."

[1]. Even in many irrigated regions, shortage of water supply allows only limited irrigation. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen the study on osmotic stress resistance of wheat.Five multi-gene families belong to transcript factors [bZIP (mainly AREB/ABF), DREB (AP2/EREBP), MYB/MYC, NAC and WRKY)] have been reported to be associated with drought tolerance. A number of wheat genes for transcript factors (TabZIP1, TabZIP60, TaABRE3, TaDREB1, TaPIMP1, TaNAC29 and TAWRKY44) have been shown to exhibit the induced expression during exposure to drought stress, suggesting that these genes may be used for improving stress tolerance in wheat [2â<U+0080><U+0093>9].Dehydration-responsive element binding (DREB) proteins constitute a large family of transcription factors regulating some functional genes closely related to drought, high-salinity and low temperature [10, 11]. Arabidopsis genome has six DREB1/CBF genes, namely DREB1A/CBF3, DREB1B/CBF1, DREB1C/CBF2, DREB1D/CBF4, DDF1/DREB1F and DDF2/DREB1E [12]. DREB genes feature three conserved regions, an EREBP/AP2 DNA binding domain [13, 14], an N-terminal nuclear localization signal, and a conserved Ser/Thr-rich region adjacent to the EREBP/AP2 domain [15, 16]. The characteristics of above three regions determine the DREB characteristics [17]. Most of the functional studies on DREB transcription factors were focused on Arabidopsis thaliana before 2002, and then in wheat, rice, soybean, cotton and other plants [18â<U+0080><U+0093>24]. DREB factors have been extensively characterized and grouped into several molecular classes based on similarities in the function or the amino acid sequence of the proteins they encode [24]. DREB1 and DREB2 are two main subgroups of the DREB subfamily, involved in two different signal transduction pathways under cold and dehydration, respectively [25]. DREB1 genes include DREB1-A, DREB1-B, DREB1-C,DREB1-D,DREB1-E and DREB1F [26]. TaDREB1 genes were located on chromosomes 3A, 3B and 3D [11], and isolated from a drought-induced cDNA library of wheat, which was found to be induced by low temperature, abscisic acid (ABA), salinity and drought [27]. The cDNA length of TaDREB1 is 1292 bp, including 837 bp open reading frame, 251 bp 5â<U+0080><U+0099>-UTR and 204 bp 3â<U+0080><U+0099>-UTR [18]. The study results showed that the heterogeneity of TaDREB1 gene haplotypes is inconsistent in drought-resistant materials or in drought-sensitive wheat materials, indicating the complexity of drought resistance. In addition, the nucleic acid polymorphisms of TaDREB1 gene are richer in wheat [26].The present research aimed at identifying the seed germination resistance varieties under osmotic stress for wheat breeding program, searching the new allelic variation of TaDREB1, looking for SNPs, InDels and transcript expression level associated with seed germination tolerance under osmotic stress, and charactering the transcript expression level of TaDREB1-A, TaDREB1-B and TaDREB1-D in wheat varieties or lines with different values of GDRI (germination drought resistance index)."

                Results
                In this study, a segregation ratio of 1:1 was observed between plants with red or green shoots in four families with RZS as the only red shoot gene donor parent, suggesting that the red shoot trait of RZS is associated with a dominant gene. Three markers, In1400â<U+0080><U+0093>1, In1579â<U+0080><U+0093>1 and In1579â<U+0080><U+0093>3, were chosen from 22 pairs of indel primers targeting regions in the vicinity of the previously identified red fruit skin locus of MRB and were able to effectively distinguish the eight red shoot plants from the eight green shoot plants. Linkage analysis indicated that the genetic distance between the two marker loci (In1579â<U+0080><U+0093>1 and In1579â<U+0080><U+0093>3) and the red shoot locus of RZS were both 1.4 cM, while the genetic distance between the In1400â<U+0080><U+0093>1 marker and the red shoot locus was 2.1 cM. The physical position of the red locus in RZS should be in the 368.6 kb candidate interval at the bottom of LG4.
              ;
                Conclusions
                The genetic locus responsible for the red tender shoots of RZS was located in the same interval of the red fruit skin gene of MRB, meaning that the bud mutation loci of RZS and MRB may be the same or adjacent to each other, and the red shoot trait and the red fruit skin trait in RZS may be controlled by the same, or a closely linked locus. As a result, breeders could use red shoots as a morphological marker to select for the red-skinned hybrids from RZS families.
              "	"Bulk segregation analysis;Indel markers;                        Pyrus; red pear"	"The pear (Pyrus spp.) is one of the main fruit trees in China and a popular fruit worldwide as a result of being nourishing, delicious and juicy. Pears are usually diploid with a genome size ranging fromâ<U+0080><U+0089>~â<U+0080><U+0089>527 Mb [1] to ~â<U+0080><U+0089>600 Mb [2]. Pear skin color is either green, yellow, russet or red [3â<U+0080><U+0093>5] with anthocyanin as the main component of red-skinned pears and the main determinant of the degree of red coloration [6, 7]. Anthocyanins contained in red-skinned pears consist of cyanidin-3-galactoside, peonidin-3-galactoside [8, 9], cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-arabinfuranoside and peonidin-3-glucoside [10, 11]. Red-skinned pears are favored by people because of their bright-colored appearance and the health benefits of anthocyanins [12â<U+0080><U+0093>14].The â<U+0080><U+0098>Max Red Bartlettâ<U+0080><U+0099> (MRB) pear, which has red tender shoots and fruits, is a red mutant cultivar of the famous European â<U+0080><U+0098>Bartlettâ<U+0080><U+0099> pear and is often used as a parent to breed new cultivars because of the strong inheritance of its bright red fruit skin [15, 16]. The red fruit skin trait of MRB is controlled by a single dominant gene called Red, which is located in the fourth linkage group (LG) [17]. The trait of red tender shoots in MRB correlates highly with the development of red fruit skin trait and are both inherited in the progeny, enabling the early identification of red-skinned fruit by their red tender shoots [18].â<U+0080><U+0098>Zaosuâ<U+0080><U+0099> (ZS) is a famous pear cultivar in China with green fruit skin and green shoots. â<U+0080><U+0098>Red Zaosuâ<U+0080><U+0099> (RZS), which has red tender shoots and fruits such as MRB, was a mutant of ZS found in Weibei, Shanxi province in China in 2004 [19]. We crossed RZS with pear cultivars that have green shoots and found that approximately half of the young seedlings had red tender shoots, indicating that the trait of red tender shoots in RZS was controlled by a dominant gene and could be inherited in its offspring. Other studies found that there might be a common mechanism of transcriptional regulation in the red fruit skin of RZS and MRB [20, 21], indicating that mutations in the same genetic locus may underlie red fruit skin and red shoot traits for RZS and MRB.In pears, most of the structural and regulatory genes responsible for anthocyanin biosynthesis have been cloned and functionally characterized [22, 23]. In the two red-blushed Asian pear cultivars â<U+0080><U+0098>Meirensuâ<U+0080><U+0099> and â<U+0080><U+0098>Yunhongli No.1â<U+0080><U+0099>, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) was found to participate in the first step of induced anthocyanin biosynthesis, while UDP-glucose: flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) was closely related to anthocyanin accumulation [7]. In another study on two other red blushed pear cultivars â<U+0080><U+0098>Mantianhongâ<U+0080><U+0099> and â<U+0080><U+0098>Aoguanâ<U+0080><U+0099>, PAL was not found to be a key enzyme for colouration, while the activity of chalcone isomerase (CHI) was found to be closely related to anthocyanin biosynthesis [24].In the European pear â<U+0080><U+0098>Early Red Doyenne du Comiceâ<U+0080><U+0099> and â<U+0080><U+0098>Green Doyenne du Comiceâ<U+0080><U+0099>, PyMADS18 was found to participate in the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis during the early stages of fruit development [25]. MYB10 interacts with transcription factors bHLH and WD40 to form an MBW transcription complex that regulate gene transcription of anthocyanin biosynthesis and, consequently, anthocyanin accumulation [26, 27]. Further studies in pears showed that the expression level of MYB10 was significantly higher in the full-red mutants (MRB and â<U+0080><U+0098>Early Red Doyenne du Comiceâ<U+0080><U+0099>compared) than in their green parents (â<U+0080><U+0098>Bartlettâ<U+0080><U+0099> and â<U+0080><U+0098>Green Doyenne du Comiceâ<U+0080><U+0099>) at early stages of development [28, 29]. The demethylation and methylation of the MYB10 (PcMYB10 and PyMYB10) promoter might be associated with red-/green-skinned mutants [20, 21]. However, PcMYB10 was located on LG9, but not LG4, of the Red locus and is unlikely to be directly responsible for the mutation of MRB [28].There had been several reports regarding the transcriptomic and proteomic level describing the bud mutation mechanisms of RZS [22, 30, 31], but none have reported on the mapping of the bud mutation locus in RZS. This locus may play an important deterministic role in the red tender shoots and red fruit skin traits of RZS. In this study, we used the indel markers selected from the interval of the red fruit skin trait locus of MRB to map the red shoot trait locus of RZS using the segregation population of a cross between â<U+0080><U+0098>PremP109â<U+0080><U+0099> and RZS. Our findings make it easier to recognize and understand the coloring mechanism of both the red traits of shoots and the red fruit skin color as well as the relationship between them."

They manifest as erythema that is pink-red in color, and they are related to skin and cutaneous tissue, usually located in the head and nuchal area, and are observed in approximately 3–5 out of every 1000 newborns [4]. In contrast, some atypical CMs occur in cutaneous zones as multiple small, white, pale halos with central red spots that are round to oval in shape [5, 6]. Importantly, these atypical CMs are hereditary in an autosomal dominant fashion, and observation allowed their mapping to the CMC1 locus on chromosome 5q13–22 [7, 8].In 2003, Eerola et al. reported six families exhibiting this atypical CM, discovered its association with RASA-1 muatation, and defined this disorder as capillary malformation- arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) [5]. Given the localized nature of the vascular anomalies, a “second hit” hypothesis was proposed as the pathomechanism of the disorder [5, 6].In addition to the multiple spots of erythema, fast-flow lesions such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as well as hypertrophic syndromes such as Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) and Parker-Weber syndrome (PKWS) were also documented in families with a RASA-1 mutation [5, 9]. However, RASA-1 mutation was occasionally discovered in syndromes of overgrowth in length, for example, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) [9, 10].CM-AVM indicates a high risk of fast-flow lesions. In a 2003 study, 6 out of 17 families manifested with atypical CM together with fast-low lesions such as AVM, AVF or PKWS [5]. Studies in 2008 and 2010 showed that approximately one-third of CM-AVM patients possess fast-flow vascular anomalies [9, 11–13].RASA-1 encodes for Ras GTPase-activating protein 1, or p120-RasGTP-activating protein (p120-RasGAP), which is a negative regulator catalyzing the conversion of Ras to its GDP-bound form [14].Mutation of GAP may affect the function of endothelial cells, leading them to form a highly vascularized network and resulting in extensive neuronal death [15]. Stimulation of annexin A6 regulates p120-RasGAP on the plasma membrane and hence controls the activity of Ras [16]. In a murine model experiment, RASA-1+/- mice had a normal phenotype, while homozygous RASA-1-/- mice died at E10.5 from the development of vascular dysfunction and increased neuronal apoptosis [15]. In the literature, most of the RASA-1 mutations associated with CM-AVM are deletions in the reading frame, causing a frame shift and subsequent a formation of a stop codon blocking further translation of the protein. These mutations result in a truncated protein with complete loss of function (LOF) of the RasGAP domain [5].In this report, we describe two CM-AVM patients with a novel mutation in the RASA-1 gene (c.3070A<U+2009>><U+2009>T) leading to LOF of the p120-RasGAP domain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CM-AVM related to a RASA-1 mutation in East Asia."

Their petals with different colors and shapes make the genus the â<U+0080><U+009C>Queen of the Vinesâ<U+0080>. However, the genomic information and phylogeny of Clematis based on existing molecular studies are limited.

Clematis is the largest genus in the family Ranunculaceae, consists of typically vigorous, woody, climbing vines, and is famous for its diverse flower shapes and colors [4]; hundreds of cultivars make it the â<U+0080><U+009C>Queen of the Vinesâ<U+0080>. C. finetianais widely distributed in south China, in Zhejiang Fujian, Guangxi, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. It is exploited and used as a medicinal plant because of triterpenoid saponins, flavonoids and many other compounds present in roots and leaves [5]. C. finetiana is an evergreen species, which enhances its use in balconies and for fences. It can keep growing vigorously in hot summer conditions, which makes it different from many other cultivars and species of Clematis. C. finetiana is loved by home gardening enthusiasts for its lovely white flowers and excellent heat-resistance properties. It is a good resource for heat tolerance breeding of ornamental Clematis.Microsatellite (SSR) markers are an important tool for the evaluation of genetic diversity and differentiation between species and populations [6, 7]. This marker type has a generally good transferability between closely related species and it is a useful tool in genetic mapping as well [8â<U+0080><U+0093>10]. Previously, only few molecular marker studies and DNA sequencing-based investigations have been reported on Clematis, including the use of ISSR primers [11], randomly amplified polymorphic DNA [12], ITS sequencing [13, 14], and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analyses of chloroplast regions accD, rps16, rpl16, trnS-trnG,atpB-rbcL, trnV-atpE and matK [15, 16]. Currently, there is a lack of SSR markers capable of effectively detecting polymorphisms in Clematis.Transcriptome sequencing has been widely used for characterizing transcriptional events in a specific tissue or during a given period. It is a very useful tool also for research on non-model species that lack sequenced genome information. The high-throughput character and low cost makes RNA-seq a good choice for genetic investigations. The data resulting from transcriptome sequencing is valuable also for molecular marker development, such as microsatellite (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. To the best of our knowledge, very few research reports are available about the application of RNA-seqin studies on Clematis [17] and no information of SSR markers in Clematis has been published. To improve precision in genetic analyses on Clematis, we developed SSR markers based on the transcriptome sequencing of C. finetiana and utilized them to investigate inter- and intraspecific diversity and differentiation and genetic relationships among Clematis samples."

In order to provide basic data for selection and optimization of molecular markers of tea plants. 118 markers, including 40 EST-SSR, 40 SRAP and 38 SCoT markers were used to evaluate the genetic diversity of 50 tea plant (Camellia sinensis.) samples collected from Qinb. tea germplasm, assess population structure.              ;
                Results
                In this study, a total of 414 alleles were obtained using 38 pairs of SCoT primers, with an average of 10.89 alleles per primer. The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB), polymorphism information content (PIC), resolving power (Rp), effective multiplex ratio (EMR), average band informativeness (Ibav), and marker index (MI) were 96.14%, 0.79, 6.71, 10.47, 0.58, and 6.07 respectively. 338 alleles were amplified via 40 pairs of SRAP (8.45 per primer), with PPB, PIC, Rp, EMR, Ibav, and MI values of 89.35%, 0.77, 5.11, 7.55, 0.61, and 4.61, respectively. Furthermore, 320 alleles have been detected using 40 EST-SSR primers (8.00 per primer), with PPB, PIC, Rp, EMR, Ibav, and MI values of 94.06%, 0.85, 4.48, 7.53, 0.56, and 4.22 respectively. These results indicated that SCoT markers had higher efficiency.
                Mantel test was used to analyze the genetic distance matrix generated by EST-SSRs, SRAPs and SCoTs. The results showed that the correlation between the genetic distance matrix based on EST-SSR and that based on SRAP was very small (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01), followed by SCoT and SRAP (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.17), then by SCoT and EST-SSR (râ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.19).
                The 50 tea samples were divided into two sub-populations using STRUCTURE, Neighbor-joining (NJ) method and principal component analyses (PCA). The results produced by STRUCTURE were completely consistent with the PCA analysis. Furthermore, there is no obvious relationship between the results produced using sub-populational and geographical data.
              ;
                Conclusion
                Among the three types of markers, SCoT markers has many advantages in terms of NPB, PPB, Rp, EMR, and MI. Nevertheless, the values of PIC showed different trends, with the highest values generated with EST-SSR, followed by SCoT and SRAP. The average band informativeness showed similar trends. Correlation between genetic distances produced by three different molecular markers were very small, thus it is not recommended to use a single marker to evaluate genetic diversity and population structure. It is hence suggested that combining of different types of molecular markers should be used to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure. It also seems crucial to screen out, for each type of molecular markers, core markers of Camellia sinensis. This study revealed that genes of exotic plant varieties have been constantly integrated into the gene pool of Qinba area tea. A low level of genetic diversity was observed; this is shown by an average coefficient of genetic similarity of 0.74.
              "	"                Camellia sinensis              ;Marker efficiency;Correlation coefficient;Genetic diversity;Population structure"	"Evaluation of genetic diversity and population structure has significant implications for genetic improvement in plant breeding. It has been well established that the genetic basis of biological organisms is concealed within the genome sequence, and that base-pair substitution, insertion, deletion, and other alterations can lead to genetic diversity; the diversity of organisms are manifested through phenotypic, chromosomal and proteomic differences. DNA molecular markers, having stable performance, high polymorphism and other properties, are increasingly employed in taxonomical, genetic evolutionary, breeding, and cloning studies. The use of different molecular markers and different primers for a same marker may result in amplification of distinct regions of the genome. Theoretically, higher numbers of polymorphic markers used are associated with wider amplified regions that covers the entire genome and more accurate results.EST-SSR (Expressed Sequence Tag-Simple Sequence Repeat) molecular markers have been widely used with many species and for many applications, such as genetic linkage mapping, comparative mapping, and evaluation of genetic diversity [1â<U+0080><U+0093>5]. SRAP (Sequence related amplified polymorphism) was first used on Brassica in 2001 by Li G [6]. The genetic diversity and population structure analysis of Camellia sinensis by SRAP [7â<U+0080><U+0093>12] have already been reported. SCoT (Start codon targeted polymorphism) marker was designed according to the Kozak sequence pattern and was developed after the discovery of the conservativeness of the initiation codon ATG (+â<U+0080><U+0089>1, +â<U+0080><U+0089>2, +â<U+0080><U+0089>3) flanking sequences, in which the positions +â<U+0080><U+0089>4, +â<U+0080><U+0089>7, +â<U+0080><U+0089>8, andâ<U+0080><U+0089>+â<U+0080><U+0089>9 are occupied by nucleotides G, A, C, and C, respectively. These seven nucleotides are generally conserved. At positions â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>3, â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>6, andâ<U+0080><U+0089>â<U+0088><U+0092>â<U+0080><U+0089>9, G is the usual nucleotide. Primers can therefore be designed according to the conservativeness of the initiation sequence SCoT marker allows single primer amplification of the region between two genes. Bertrand et al. first applied this marker on Oryza sativa [13]. Lately, SCoT molecular marker has been used to access the genetic diversity of plant species such as Saccharum spontaneum L [14], Dactylis glomerata [15], Mangifera indica [16], Arachis hypogaea [17], Saccharum officinarum [18], Podocarpus macrophyllus [19] and Paeonia suffruticosa [20]. Nevertheless, no similar study has been conducted on Camellia sinensis. Tea plant is an allogamous species; theoretically, after prolonged spontaneous hybridization, the genetic background of tea plant should be increasingly complex.China is one of the main sources of tea germplasms. Currently, there are 1,100,000 ha of tea planting area, with different regions growing different types and different varieties of tea according to topographic, soil, and climatic characteristics. Xinan, Huanan, Jiangnan, and Jiangbei represent the four main districts of tea planting area in China. The Qinba area belongs to the Jiangbei district. In this research, 50 tea varieties, including those collected from different districts, common tea plant species, as well as local species in the Qinba area, were genotyped with EST-SSR, SRAP, and SCoT markers. Herein we constructed three types of molecular marker dataset which have important applications in diversity analysis, marker efficiency analysis, and correlation analysis that use these marker systems. Our study allowed the establishment of population structure, providing significant insights into the selection of molecular markers for tea plant breeding."

                Data of gene expression profiles (GSE28424) and miRNA expression profiles (GSE28423) were downloaded from GEO database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMIs) were obtained by R Bioconductor packages. Functional and enrichment analyses of selected genes were performed using DAVID database. Proteinâ<U+0080><U+0093>protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING and visualized in Cytoscape. The relationships among the DEGs and module in PPI network were analyzed by plug-in NetworkAnalyzer and MCODE seperately.

                Totally 346 DEGs and 90 DEMIs were found to be differentially expressed. These DEGs were enriched in biological processes and KEGG pathway of inflammatory immune response. 25 genes in the PPI network were selected as hub genes. Top 10 hub genes were TYROBP, HLA-DRA, VWF, PPBP, SERPING1, HLA-DPA1, SERPINA1, KIF20A, FERMT3, HLA-E. PPI network of DEGs followed a pattern of power law network and met the characteristics of small-world network. MCODE analysis identified 4 clusters and the most significant cluster consisted of 11 nodes and 55 edges. SEPP1, CKS2, TCAP, BPI were identified as the seed genes in their own clusters, respectively. The miRNA-mRNA regulation network which was composed of 89 pairs was established. MiR-210 had the highest connectivity with 12 target genes. Among the predicted target of MiR-96, HLA-DPA1 and TYROBP were the hub genes.

                Our study indicated possible differentially expressed genes and miRNA, and microRNA-mRNA negative regulatory networks in osteosarcoma by bioinformatics analysis, which may provide novel insights for unraveling pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.
              "	"Osteosarcoma;Bioinformatics;Functional enrichment analysis;Regulatory network"	"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone cancer in children and adolescents, which originates from mesenchymal stem cells and exhibits osteoblastic differentiation [1]. The incidence rate of osteosarcoma is approximately one to three cases per million each year worldwide [2]. With the development of surgery and chemotherapy, the survival rate in osteosarcoma patients without distal metastasis has been largely increased [3]. However, despite improvements in osteosarcoma therapy over the last three decades, the overall survival of patients has reached a plateau and about 30â<U+0080><U+0093>40% of the patients experience progressive metastasis within 5 years after diagnosis and die [4]. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to explore novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma.In recent years, the developments in molecular biology have provided some new insights into potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for osteosarcoma. For instance, it was found that SPARCL1 was downregulated in osteosarcoma by epigenetic methylation of promoter DNA and activating the expression of SPARCL1 could inhibit the osteosarcoma metastasis in vitro and in vivo [5]. NRP2 was reported to be up-regulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues, and associated with poor survival of osteosarcoma patients [6]. On the other hand, numerous studies shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play essential roles in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis by negatively regulating expression level of target gene. MiR-497, for instance, can activate P21 expression by inhibiting the expression of MAPK/Erk signaling pathway, and promote the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells [7]. However, the miRNA-mRNA negative regulation network in osteosarcoma had been not fully delineated by now.In this study we used bioinformatics methods to integrate miRNA and mRNA expression data, which are available in the GEO database, to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMIs) between osteosarcoma and normal cell, and establish the miRNA-mRNA negative regulation network, aiming to provide valuable information for use in defining the mechanism of pathogenesis in osteosarcoma."

                Conclusion
                These molecular markers have a high potential for use in breeding for Al tolerance in sorghum.
              "	"Aluminium tolerance;Mapping population;Molecular markers;Net root length in aluminium;                Sorghum bicolor
              "	"Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), is a staple cereal in many parts of Africa and Asia where it is grown mostly on small-scale, resource poor holdings. Although it is a hardy cereal, its production is significantly reduced by aluminium (Al) stress, especially in the highly leached acidic soils [1, 2]. Inhibition of root growth is the primary symptom of Al stress in plants [3, 4]. The primary consequence of Al stress is a poorly developed root system that makes the crop vulnerable to drought and limited nutrient uptake [5] and ultimately reduced crop yields [6]. In Kenya, over 70% of sorghum is produced in the western and central regions. These areas are characterized by acid soils [7] with Al percent saturation ranging from 4 to 46% [8]. Low sorghum grain yield in the country is partly attributed to acid soil stress [9] including Al toxicity. Therefore, there is the need to deploy Al tolerant sorghum cultivars in order to increase productivity.Plant tolerance to aluminium stress is based on exclusion or internal mechanisms that enable Al to be tolerated once it has entered the plant cells [10, 11]. Some plant species accumulate Al and complexed it with other substances to render it less toxic [12]. Al tolerant cultivars of sorghum and most other cereals use the Al exclusion mechanisms based mainly on secretion of organic acids, such as citrate, malate and oxalate that chelate Al outside the cells and thereby reduce its availability [13, 14]. When exposed to Al stress, tolerant sorghum varieties reportedly secrete large quantities of citric acid [14], malic acid and trans-aconitic acids [15, 16]. Aluminium-induced exudation of organic acids in plant roots is mediated by anionic channels in the plasma membrane [12]. The plant genes involved in the Al-induced acid exudation are members of the aluminium activated malate transporter (ALMT) and the multi-drug and toxin extrusion (MATE) families that encode membrane transporter proteins [14, 17, 18].Although significant progress has been made in crop improvement through phenotypic selection for Al tolerance [5, 19–21], the testing procedures may be difficult and time consuming due to the effect of genotype by environment interactions for this trait. In this regard, molecular markers based screening procedure can be more efficient than the use of morphological markers in identifying Al tolerant sorghum genotypes.Sorghum has significant genotypic variation for tolerance to Al [22, 23], which can be exploited to breed genotypes with superior tolerance to Al stress. Significant progress has been made in developing genomic tools and resources related to aluminium tolerance in sorghum, including the development of some molecular markers that can be used for marker assisted selection [14, 23–27]. However, additional work has to be done through exploring global sorghum genetic resources to identify additional genomic regions that contribute to this trait and eventually develop sets of molecular markers that can be used to efficiently breed sorghum for Al tolerance.An aluminium tolerance locus referred to as AltSB                 was identified through comparative mapping procedure in sorghum [24]. This locus was later found to underlie SbMATE, a MATE family gene, which encodes a protein that is responsible for citric acid exudation [14]. Causative polymorphisms that include insertions and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that were positively correlated with aluminium tolerance have been identified within this gene [27]. STS markers designated as CTG29 and M181 have been reported to be closely linked to AltSB
                 at 0.2 cM and 0 cM, respectively [14]. However, it was not known whether the sorghum population used in this study relied on AltSB
                 or different Al tolerance gene(s). Conserved gene order in genomic regions harboring Al tolerance loci has been reported in members of the grass family [23]. Hence, with the availability of saturated genetic maps of major cereals, it is possible to identify markers linked to Al tolerance genes in sorghum that are orthologous to Al tolerance genes in other cereal crops. The present study was conducted to identify molecular markers associated with genes/QTLs that confer tolerance to aluminium toxicity in sorghum."

                Results
                We conducted a genome-wide study and evaluated the population structure of 182 Han Chinese, 90 Japanese and 100 Korean individuals, together with the data of 630 individuals representing 8 populations wordwide. Our analyses revealed that Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations have distinct genetic makeup and can be well distinguished based on either the genome wide data or a panel of ancestry informative markers (AIMs). Their genetic structure corresponds well to their geographical distributions, indicating geographical isolation played a critical role in driving population differentiation in East Asia. The most recent common ancestor of the three populations was dated back to 3000 ~â<U+0080><U+0089>3600 years ago. Our analyses also revealed substantial admixture within the three populations which occurred subsequent to initial splits, and distinct gene introgression from surrounding populations, of which northern ancestral component is dominant.

              "	"Han Chinese;Japanese;Korean;Genetic ancestry;Population structure;Population divergence;Admixture;SNP"	"East Asia is one of the worldâ<U+0080><U+0099>s most populated places, consisting of about 38% of the Asian population or about 22% of the world-wide population. East Asian peoples, especially the three major ethnicities, Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean, share many similarities in characteristics, for example, yellow skin, black eyes and black hair, short and flat noses, which make them hard to be distinguished by appearance. Moreover, East Asian people use similar languages and words, for example, Chinese characters are shared in Japanese, and also existed in Korean until their recent abolition in the 1940s [1].While many studies have reported the overall picture of genetic structure of global populations, finer scale details of population structure and relevant issues in East Asia have not yet been well addressed. In fact, in many previous studies, samples of Han Chinese and Japanese populations were generally treated as a single group [2], and notably, Korean samples are frequently absent from many important international collaborative projects due to their assumed similarity to Han Chinese and Japanese samples, such as the International HapMap Project [3] and the 1000 Genomes Project [4]. A recent study [5] provided a landscape of autosomal variation and an overall picture of the genetic relationship of Asian populations. However, fine scale genetic structure and relationship among Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations have not been revealed or well-studied, partially due to low density of the data.Here, we newly genotyped 100 Korean samples, and conducted a joint population genetic analysis with 182 Han Chinese individuals and 90 Japanese individuals. We attempted to address some fundamental questions related to the population histories of the three ethnic groups. First, we asked what the genetic make-up of the three populations is and how well they are differentiated. Second, we attempted to dissect population history of the three ethnic groups and infer their genetic origins based on state-of-art methods developed recently. Finally, we asked whether there were subsequent gene-flow occurred since population splits. We believe these efforts can advance our understanding of human genetic diversity and migration history in East Asia, and provide insightful information for future medical studies in the three East Asian populations."

To elucidate evolutionary history, the genome and mitochondrial DNA are traditionally used to estimate divergence time [2]. Transcriptome sequencing has become a viable alternative to provide rapid developing genomic resources in non-model organisms [3, 4]. Comparative transcriptome analysis is used to estimate the non-synonymous substitution (Ka) and synonymous substitution (Ks) rates to calculate the evolutionary rate [5, 6] and hence, to identify genes involved in environmental adaptation. Distribution of synonymous substitutions can be used to calculate the divergent time based on the coding sequence [2, 7].The Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus is a typical urodele, and an important species both as a biological resource and with respect to its value as a living fossil [8]. The species was historically widespread in China, but environmental degradation and human killing have led to its severe decline in the wild. From 1980s, it is classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Nature Resources. Because of its irreplaceable protection status and good taste, artificial propagation technology was studied and succeeded at the end of 1990s. Success of artificial propagation technology provided a value way to protect the wild resources. In wild, it is aquatic in all life stages and typically inhabits rocky crevices in banks of streams and lakes, as well as subterranean rivers. To identify genes possibly related to A. davidianus adaptation to its aquatic life history and to a cave habitat, transcriptome data of other amphibian species were obtained from GenBank, and comparative transcriptome analysis was carried out to detect genes positively selected for in evolution."

However, about 40% of patients with ERÎ±â<U+0080><U+0089>+â<U+0080><U+0089>breast cancer who receive tamoxifen therapy eventually develop resistance resulting in a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to mine available data sets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (tissue samples), and to identify all miRNAs associated with tamoxifen resistance (TamR) in breast cancer. Secondly, this study aimed to predict the key gene regulatory networks of newly found TamR-related miRNAs and evaluate the potential role of the miRNAs and targets as potential prognosis biomarkers for breast cancer patients.              ;
                Result
                Microarray data sets from two different studies were used from the GEO database: 1. GSE66607: miRNA of MCF-7 TamR cells; 2. GSE37405: TamR tissues. Differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified in both data sets and 5 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to overlap between the two data sets. Profiles of GSE37405 and data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter Database (KMPD) along with Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) were used to reveal the relationship between these 5 miRNAs and overall survival. The results showed that has-miR-542-5p was the only miRNA associated with overall survival of ERÎ±â<U+0080><U+0089>+â<U+0080><U+0089>breast cancer patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen. Targets of has-miR-542-5p were predicted by miRanda and TargetScan, and the mRNA expression of the three 3 target gene, Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/Tryptophan 5-Monooxygenase Activation Protein Beta (YWHAB), Lymphocyte Antigen 9 (LY9), and Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) were associated with overall survival in 2 different databases. Copy-number alterations (CNAs) of SFRP1 confer survival disadvantage to breast cancer patients and alter the mRNA expression of SFRP1 in cBioPortal database.

                Conclusion
                This study indicates that miRNA has-miR-542-5p is associated with TamR and can predict prognosis of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, has-miR-542-5p may be acting through a mechanism involving the target genes YWHAB, LY9, and SFRP1. Overall, has-miR-542-5p is a predictive biomarker and potential target for therapy of breast cancer patients.
              "	"Breast cancer;Tamoxifen resistance;Bioinformatics;miRNA-542-5p"	"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and second leading cause of cancer death in the USA [1â<U+0080><U+0093>3]. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator and one of the most effective adjuvant treatments for estrogen receptor alpha positive (ERÎ±+) breast cancer patients in clinical practice. Unfortunately, about 40% of breast cancer patients with ERÎ±â<U+0080><U+0089>+â<U+0080><U+0089>who receive tamoxifen therapy develop tamoxifen resistance (TamR) [4, 5].The mechanisms of TamR include aberrant ERÎ± expression, altered signal transduction pathways, imbalance of co-regulatory proteins, genetic polymorphisms in tamoxifen metabolism [6, 7], and epigenetic modifications including expression changes of microRNAs (miRNAs) [8]. miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally control the translation and stability of mRNAs [9] by forming specific base-pairing interactions between the 5â<U+0080>² end of the miRNA (seed region) and the miRNA response elements within the coding region or untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, leading to mRNA destabilization and/or translational inhibition [10]. Fundamentally, miRNAs provide an extra level of regulation to gene expression.The role of miRNAs in the progression of endocrine-resistant breast cancer is of intense interest as they are promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets to counter metastatic disease [11]. Consequently, studies are rapidly emerging on the role of miRNAs in endocrine resistant breast cancer [12, 13]. Several miRNAs have been associated with TamR in MCF-7 cells exposed to tamoxifen (1 Î¼M) for >12 months [14]. For example, expressions of miR-190b and miR-516a-5p were altered in TamR cells and were predictive of treatment outcome in a cohort of ERÎ±â<U+0080><U+0089>+â<U+0080><U+0089>breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen mono-therapy [13]; miR-519a confers TamR by targeting a network of tumor-suppressor genes in ERÎ±â<U+0080><U+0089>+â<U+0080><U+0089>breast cancer [15]; miR-27b is epigenetically downregulated in TamR breast cancer cells due to promoter methylation and also regulates tamoxifen sensitivity by targeting High Mobility Group Box 3 [16]; miR-320a sensitizes TamR breast cancer cells to tamoxifen by targeting CAMP Regulated Phosphoprotein 19 and ERRÎ³ in breast cancer cells and tissues [17]; and miR-378a-3p regulates tamoxifen sensitivity in MCF-7 cells through targeting Golgi Transport 1A [18].In this study, we used a meta-analysis approach to discover which miRNAs are associated with TamR across multiple studies in order to reveal strong miRNA candidates and down-stream target genes that can be used as predictive biomarkers and novel targets for therapy. To accomplish this, we mined the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed all the available in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (tissue samples) data sets for miRNAs associated with TamR in breast cancer, identified all the miRNAs related to TamR, predicted the key gene regulatory network of a novel miRNA associated with TamR, and evaluated the potential role of this miRNA and target genes as prognosis biomarkers for breast cancer patients. This is the first study to indicate and validate the potential association of miR-542-5p and its downstream genes Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/Tryptophan 5-Monooxygenase Activation Protein Beta (YWHAB), Lymphocyte Antigen 9 (LY9), and Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) with the prognosis of breast cancer."

However, it is not known if calcium signaling pathway genes are also associated with SCZ in Han Chinese population.              ;                Methods
                Here we investigated the association between genetic variants in three calcium signaling pathway genes (CACNB2, CACNA1C and CACNA1I) and SCZ in 1615 SCZ cases and 1597 controls.

                Results
                A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs4522708) in CACNA1I is significantly associated with SCZ in our Chinese sample (ORA alleleâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1.19, corrected Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.042), suggesting that CACNA1I may also be a risk gene for SCZ in Chinese population.

Meta-analysis of Chinese and European samples further strengthened the association of rs4522708 with SCZ (ORA alleleâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1.074, Pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>6.26â<U+0080><U+0089>Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>10â<U+0088><U+0092>11). Expression analysis showed that CACNA1I was significantly up-regulated in hippocampus of SCZ cases compared with controls, implying that dysregulation of CACNA1I may have a role in schizophrenia pathogenesis.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Our study suggests that CACNA1I is a risk gene for SCZ in Chinese population and provides further evidence that supports the potential role of neuronal calcium signaling in schizophrenia.
              "	"Schizophrenia;                CACNA1I              ;Genetic association;Gene expression"	"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder that affects about 1% of the worldâ<U+0080><U+0099>s population [1]. The core symptoms of SCZ include delusions, hallucinations and cognitive dysfunction [2, 3]. Adoption, family and twin studies indicated that SCZ has a strong genetic component [4]. The heritability of SCZ was estimated about 80% [4, 5], suggesting that genetic factor plays a crucial role in SCZ. Though numerous genetic linkage and association studies have been carried out in different ethnic populations and multiple susceptibility genes have been identified [6â<U+0080><U+0093>8], only limited risk genes have been consistently replicated in diverse populations. The advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provides an opportunity to dissect the genetic basis of SCZ. In the past decade, multiple GWAS have been performed in worldâ<U+0080><U+0099>s populations and multiple promising risk variants and genes have been reported [9â<U+0080><U+0093>13]. In 2014, the schizophrenia working group of the psychiatric genomics consortium (PGC2) conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of GWAS through using 36,989 SCZ cases and 113,075 controls [13]. Over 100 SCZ-associated loci have been identified by PGC. A detailed characterization of the risk loci showed that calcium signaling pathway genes may play pivotal roles in SCZ [13]. Two calcium signaling pathway genes (including CACNA1C and CACNA1I) showed robust association with SCZ in PGC2, strongly implying these genes may be involved in SCZ pathogenesis. In addition, another calcium signaling pathway gene (CACNB2) was also reported to be associated with SCZ [14]. A recent trans-ancestry meta-analyses of Chinese and PGC2 samples (a total of 43,175 cases and 65,166 controls) further supports the association between CACNB2, CACNA1C, CACNA1I genes and schizophrenia [15]. These findings strongly suggest that neuronal calcium signaling pathway is involved in schizophrenia. To further investigate if these calcium signaling pathway genes are also associated with SCZ in Han Chinese population, we performed a replication study through recruiting 1615 SCZ cases and 1597 controls. We first genotyped three SNPs (one SNP in CACNB2, one SNP in CACNA1C and one SNP in CACNA1I) and tested their associations with SCZ in a Chinese sample. We then explored the expression level of these three genes in schizophrenia cases and controls. Our study indicates that a SNP in CACNA1I is significantly associated with SCZ in Chinese population, suggesting that CACNA1I is also a risk gene for SCZ in Han Chinese."

The population also contain individuals with the Swedish long QT syndrome (LQTS1) founder mutation (KCNQ1/p.Y111C) which in homozygotes causes the Jervell & Lange Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) and hearing loss (HL).                Aims of the study were to test whether the Swedish long QT founder mutation originated in an ancestral HFE family and if carriers had an increased risk for hemochromatosis (HH), a treatable disorder. We also aimed to identify the pathogenic mutation causing the hearing loss disorder segregating in the pedigree.              ;
                Methods
                LQTS patients were asked about their ancestry and possible origin in a HH family. They were also offered a predictive testing for the HFE genotype. Church books were screened for families with hearing loss. One HH family had two members with hearing loss, who underwent molecular genetic analysis of the LQTS founder mutation, connexin 26 and thereafter exome sequencing. Another family with hearing loss in repeat generations was also analyzed for connexin 26 and underwent exome sequencing.
              ;
                Results
                Of nine LQTS patients studied, four carried a HFE mutation (two p.C282Y, two p.H63D), none was homozygous. Three LQTS patients confirmed origin in a female founder ( b 1694, identical to AJ b 1694, a HFE pedigree member from the Fax river. Her descent of 44 HH families, included also 29 families with hearing loss (HL) suggesting JLNS. Eleven LQTS probands confirmed origin in a second founder couple (b 1614/1605) in which the woman b 1605 was identical to a HFE pedigree member from the FjÃ¤llsjÃ¶ river. In her descent there were not only 64 HH, six WND families, one JLNS, but also 48 hearing loss families. Most hearing loss was non syndromic and caused by founder effects of the late 16th century. One was of Swedish origin carrying the WHRN, c.1977delC, (p.S660Afs*30) mutation, the other was a TMC1(NM_138691),c.1814T>C,(p.L605P) mutation, possibly of Finnish origin.

                Conclusions
                Deep human HFE genealogies show HFE to be associated with other genetic disorders like WilsonÂ´s disease, LQTS, JLNS, and autosomal recessive hearing loss. Two new homozygous HL mutations in WHRN/p.S660Afs*30 and TMC1/p.L605P were identified,none of them previously reported from Scandinavia. The rarity of JLNS was possibly caused by miscarriage or intrauterine death. Most hearing loss (81.7%) was seen after 1844 when first cousin marriages were permitted. However, only 10 (10.3%) came from 1st cousin unions and only 2 (2.0 %) was born out of wedlock.

              "	"River valley populations of northern Sweden are well suited for research of monogenic diseases because the wilderness between them creates sub-isolates [1]. This usually mean a good breeding ground for autosomal recessive (AR) diseases like hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), common in the river valleys of JÃ¤mtland [2, 3]. In this disease, homozygous carriers of the HFE/p.C282Y mutation have an increased ability to absorb iron due to reduced levels of hepcidin, the iron regulating hormone of the liver [4].With time, the iron loading can reach toxic amounts affecting multiple organs in particular the liver, but most often the phenotype is mild. The disease was once regarded rare in Scandinavia and England, possibly due to widespread iron deficiencies in these countries [5]. Paradoxically these and other north European countries today demonstrate the highest mutation frequencies in the world, suggesting selective advantages [6, 7]. A recent study seemed to indicate that that the HFE/p.C282Y could segregate other mutations, when WilsonÂ´s disease (WND), a rare recessive copper loading disorder [8, 9] appeared in a HH family of the Swedish west coast. Shortly afterwards this was repeated in a deep HFE family of the FjÃ¤llsjÃ¶ river in northern JÃ¤mtland [10]. The Swedish long QT syndrome (LQTS) founder mutation is now reported to originate in this population [11].LQTS is an autosomal dominant inherited cardiac arrhythmic disorder which in homozygotes also causes hearing loss, and the Jervell and Lange- Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) [12], a surprisingly rare disorder, according to a recent study by the same authors [13]. By extensive genealogic investigations the authors were able to trace individuals carrying the long QT mutation (KCNQ1/p.Y111C) to common founders, one, a female born 1694 [14], the other a couple born 1605 and 1614 [11]. The origin and geographic spread of the LQTS mutation, described in detailed maps [11] fascinated us as it seemed to coincide with the p.C282Y mutation [2] in its upstream spread into Lapland. This land of 15000 km2 north of N 63.9 was opened for colonization by the Lapland Bill of 1673, a matter of great relief for expanding post war populations such as the FjÃ¤llsjÃ¶ (from nâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>91 in 1620 to nâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>299 in 1751) [15]. As an upstream migration would most likely result in matches between mutation carriers and risk for homozygous children [2, 3, 16] we would expect not only HH but also JLNS along the lines of descent. Despite a law change in 1844 permitting 1st cousin unions [17], JLNS was surprisingly rare as only one (p.Y111C/p.Y111C) afflicted individual have been found [13]. Singular JLNS subjects have however, been reported [18] and according to a parish meeting protocol (from 1831) there were families with deaf mute children in the new habitat [19]. Assuming they may represent historic JLNS, church registries were screened for hearing loss families.The only way at this time to identify the two LQTS founder families [11, 14] was to ask systematically LQTS patients about their ancestry and its possible origin in hemochromatosis founder families. Like HH patients [2, 3] LQTS families have been detected and reported [20] from the county hospital in Ã<U+0096>stersund and subsequently by other workers (Olof LÃ¶vheim and Anders Gard) at the same hospital.Aims                The purpose of this study was to find out whether patients with the Swedish LQTS founder mutation (KCNQ1/p.Y111C) had an increased risk for HH, by sharing origin within hemochromatosis (HH) families.

              ;
                Results
                In this study, we created five hybrid populations by crossing seven E. sibiricus genotypes that have seed shattering variation. Then, nine EST-SSR primers were used for hybrid identification based on DNA fingerprinting, and genetic diversity analysis of hybrid populations and their respective parents. A total of 15 hybrids were identified. An analysis of amplified polymorphic bands among genuine hybrids and their respective parents revealed mainly two types of markers: 1) hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in both parents; 2)hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in male parents. For each hybrid population, the total number of amplified bands ranged from 37 to 57, the percentage of polymorphism varied from 65.12% to 75.68%, with an average of 70.51%. Novel bands found in each hybrid population varied from 0 to 9 bands, suggesting an occurrence of rearrangements in the hybrid population. The structure analysis revealed that all hybrid populations and parents were assigned to eight groups. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed similar results.

                Conclusions
                In general, this study proved EST-SSR markers are efficient for hybrid identification, and suggested more genetic variation could be captured in hybrid populations by crossing breeding.
              "	"                Elymus sibiricus              ;EST-SSR marker;Hybrid identification;Genetic diversity"	"                        Elymus sibiricus L., named also siberian wild rye, is a perennial, caespitose, gramineous Elymus forage grass [1], indigenous to Northern Asia [2]. Its natural geographic distribution extends from Sweden to Japan and even to parts of Alaska and Canada [3]. It is wildly utilized in cultivated pasture and natural grassland in north China, owing to its excellent tolerance to low temperature and drought, and good forage quality and palatability [4].In recent years, overgrazing and climate change resulted in grassland degeneration, it has created a need for revegetation/restoration of rangeland ecosystems in north China. As a native grass in north China, E.sibiricus have the potential to be used in degenerated grassland due to its good adaptability to local environment. However, few E.sibiricus cultivars are available for revegetation /restoration projects in these regions. Until now, progress in cultivar development and improvement in E.sibiricus has seriously lagged behind crop plants even other forage grasses. In the last 20 years, only 6 cultivars have been developed from wild materials [5]. Meanwhile, this species has serious problem with seed shattering. In previous study, we have identified some low seed shattering genotypes from wild E.sibiricus germplasm originated from northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau [4]. These materials are valuable genetic resources for seed shattering improvement in future breeding program. Cross breeding is an effective way to create new varieties with beneficial characteristic or improved traits, and to broaden genetic base of E. sibiricus [6]. Generally, these resynthesized breeding materials are genetically diverse from inbred line/cultivar [7], and might have higher heterosis than their parents [8]. Traditionally, we identify hybrids and analyze genetic diversity through morphological traits such as plant height, inflorescence, leaf shape, etc. The process of identification is time-consuming, and the accuracy of morphological identification is also limited due to the influence of environment factors. Compared to conventional hybrid identification through morphological difference in the course of plant breeding, marker-assisted selection (MAS) is more efficient way as it is reproducible, reliable, and independent from environmental conditions, it therefore could be used to mirror directly genetic diversity [9].Among the available molecular markers, SSRs (simple sequence repeats) or microsatellites, offer an important DNA marker system for hybrid purity testing because of their co-dominance, reproducibility, robustness, and multi-allelic nature [10]. The characteristics of co-dominance give enormous advantages to SSR marker, which can be more clearly to present the band feature of parent plant and their offspring in plant breeding [11]. SSR markers have been widely used to assess hybrid purity in maize [12], rice [13], sunflower [14], cabbage [15], bunching onion [16], cauliflower [17] and some forage grasses like orchardgrass [18]. In addition, SSR markers have been successfully used to distinguish E. sibiricus and E. nutans originated from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau [19] and detect genetic diversity and variation of E. sibiricus accessions worldwide [20]. There are no previous reports of hybrid identification using EST-SSR markers. Genetic information on hybrid populations is limited in E.sibiricus.In this study, we used EST-SSR markers to identify hybrid based on specially amplified DNA fingerprinting and analyze genetic diversity of five hybrid populations and their respective parents in E. sibiricus. This study will help lay a foundation for future E. sibiricus breeding program."

                In this study, four cold-inducible PvDREB1s were identified from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), among which PvDREB1C was the one responded to cold stress later than the other three PvDREB1s. Yet, ectopic overexpression of PvDREB1C led to significantly compromised, instead of improved cold tolerance in transgenic tobacco. On the other hand, PvDREB1C was transcriptionally down-regulated in response to salt stress, but overexpression of PvDREB1C improved plant salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco. The improved salt tolerance was associated with increased K+/Na+ ratio and Ca2+ content, higher cellular osmotic potential, and activation of stress-related functional genes in the leaves of transgenic plants under salt stress.

                The current results implied that PvDREB1C played opposite roles in plant cold and salt tolerance. Although DREB1s were known as positive stress regulators, particular attentions shall be paid to their potential negative regulatory role(s).
              "	"Switchgrass;DREB/CBF;Dual function;Cold;Salt;Stress"	"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a perennial, C4 tall grass used for biofuel and forage feedstock production, water and soil conservation, as well as habitat restoration [1–3]. Switchgrass is known for its wide adaptation to diverse and relatively harsh environment [4]. However, genetic improvement of switchgrass is highly desirable to successfully establish switchgrass in marginal lands with minimal biomass sacrifice and little cost of resource and labor inputs.The C-repeat-binding factors/DRE-binding factors (CBF/DREBs) constitute an indispensable regulatory network for plant tolerance against abiotic stresses (e.g. cold, drought and salinity, etc.) [5]. DREBs primarily function through transactivating the expression of downstream functional genes through binding to the C-repeat/dehydration responsive (CRT/DRE) cis-elements [6]. Previous studies revealed that CBFs play important roles in plant cold tolerance through the IEC1-CBF regulon to activate the expression of downstream cold-responsive genes [7]. CBF/DREBs (e.g. OsDREB1D and OsDREB1F) were also reported to positively regulate plant salt and drought tolerances [8, 9]. Despite the importance of DREB family genes in plant stress tolerance, there is limited information about switchgrass DREB genes and their functional roles.The objective of this study was to analyze the biological function of a DREB1 gene for its potential use in switchgrass genetic improvement. The cloned switchgrass DREB1C was up-regulated by cold stress but down-regulated by salt and osmotic stress. Yet, over-expression of PvDREB1C in transgenic tobacco led to compromised cold tolerance, but improved salt tolerance with lower Na+/K+ ratio and higher reactive oxygen scavenging enzyme activities under salt stress."

                Results
                In this study, almonds were sequenced with Illumina paired-end sequencing technology to obtain transcriptome data and develop simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. We generated approximately 64 million clean reads from the various tissues of mixed almonds, and a total of 42,135 unigenes with an average length of 988 bp were obtained in the present study.

The almond belongs to the genus Prunus, subgenus Amygdalus [1]. Almonds are widely used in food production and have high nutritional value [2]. Most Amygdalus wild species are highly tolerant of cold, drought and salt [3]. Almonds are a typical outbreeding species with gametophyte self-incompatibility [4]. They are also an antioxidant source [5] and an important germplasm resource in breeding programmes [6]. Because almonds have high nutritional value, past research has largely focused on physicochemical properties, seed nutrients and oil extraction [2, 7, 8]. However, despite high economic and nutritional values, genome and genetic resources regarding almonds are scarce, which has restricted the development of modern breeding technologies for almonds.Molecular markers are important tools used in evaluating genetic diversity among plant species and plant molecular breeding (marker-assisted breeding). In almond trees, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been developed, but currently, there are only 3926 ESTs and gene loci available for almond in the NCBI GenBank database. Therefore, the number of ESTs is not sufficient to address almond tree molecular breeding development. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are widely used in studies on genetic diversity and relationships of plants because they are highly polymorphic, co-dominant and reproducible [9]. Moreover, SSRs markers could be used in the QTL mapping of important agronomical traits loci and marker-assisted selection in almond trees [10â<U+0080><U+0093>13]. Presently, however, only a few SSRs have been reported in almonds [14â<U+0080><U+0093>16]. SRAP and AFLP markers have been used to study genetic diversity and relationships in wild Amygdalus species [2]. A transcriptome is the complete collection of RNA that includes the full range of mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and other noncoding RNA molecules expressed by one or a group of cells, organs or tissues in a particular environment or a specific developmental stage. The Illumina paired-end sequencing technique has been widely used for transcriptome analysis in plants [10, 17â<U+0080><U+0093>19].Transcriptome sequencing is helpful in developing SSR molecular markers, as it is reliable and efficient [20]. However, transcriptomic and associated molecular markers in almonds have not yet been reported. In this study, Illumina sequencing technology was used to analyse the transcriptome of almonds and develop EST-SSR markers. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the almond transcriptome. Our study will provide a foundation for almond molecular biology and molecular breeding of almonds."

In this study, we used Illumina sequencing to determine the global gene expression profiles in horses with white-colored coats and those with black-colored coats, with the goal of identifying novel genes that could regulate horse coat color.              ;
                Results
                Genes encoding ribosomal-associated proteins were highly expressed in horse skin. We found a total of 231 unigenes that were differentially expressed between horses with white coats and horses with black coats; 119 were down-regulated, and 112 were up-regulated. Many of the up-regulated genes in black horses, such as genes related to tyrosine metabolism, may directly regulate dark coat color. Keratin genes, MIA family genes, fatty acid-related genes, and melanoma-associated genes were also differentially regulated, which suggests that they may play important roles in coat color formation.

                These findings show that the transcription profiles from white and black horse skin provide useful information to understand the genetics underlying the control of skin melanin synthesis in horses, which may enhance our knowledge of human skin diseases, such as melanoma and albinism.
              "	"Mongolian horse;RNA-Seq;Coat color;Pigmentation;Tyrosine"	"Mammalian coat colors are determined by the quantities and distributions of melanin, which are dependent on the interaction between the genotype and the environment [1]. The most important pigments, including melanin and its derivatives, are synthesized in melanocytes by oxidation of tyrosine or tyrosine-related materials.Mutation analyses have identified various genes that are involved in determining coat color in the horse [2]. Many of these genes regulate the expression and distribution of melanin, and their mutation can cause different phenotypes of the coat, skin, and eyes. Many of these gene mutations are situated within more than 60 loci that affect phenotype, and most are highly conserved in mammals, though the extent of their effect on pigment deposition varies [3]. Genes that commonly regulate skin and coat color in different mammalian species can be separated into 2 categories: one regulates the production, proliferation, or migration of different types of melanocytes, and the other affects pigment synthesis directly. Therefore, the formation of different skin and coat colors is determined by the regulation of genes that can change the progression/differentiation of melanocytes or the process of melanin synthesis [2].At the cellular level, melanocytes put pigment granules into hair and skin cells; the presence and function of melanocytes therefore determine the amount, type, and character of pigmentation. Melanocytes originate along the neural crest, which also gives rise to the spinal cord and brain, and then migrate to the skin during embryogenesis [4]. The importance of this is that the pigmentary and nervous systems are closely allied in the embryo, and certain genes affect both.Melanocytes can produce either pheomelanin or eumelanin as determined by a receptor on their surface, MC1R [5]. This receptor is activated by melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which is secreted by the pituitary gland. When activation occurs, the cells form eumelanin, while in the absence of activation, the cells form pheomelanin [6]. Whether the receptor becomes activated is determined by 2 factors: the presence or absence of melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the presence or absence of cell surface receptors. Because melanocyte-stimulating hormone is consistently available to most cells in horses, regulation at the level of surface receptors is more important.Previous studies to identify genes involved in skin pigmentation have focused on genetic polymorphisms. In the present study, we generated transcriptome profiles for horses with black or white skin utilizing high-throughput RNA deep-sequencing technology. Black and white skin from Mongolian horses was collected, and differentially expressed genes were identified by RNA-Seq, a high-throughput sequencing platform that allows for the detection and quantification of transcripts at low abundance, including novel transcript units [7]. The identification of genes for melanin production, distribution, and formation can provide a theoretical basis for the selection of skin traits during the selective breeding of horses. Additionally, increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in skin pigmentation may have significance for other animals, including humans, in terms of skin-related diseases such as melanoma and albinism."

A plethora of steps are required to form, from a precursor, the mature miRNA that eventually acts on its target RNA to repress its expression or to inhibit translation. Recently, Drosophila nibbler (nbr) has been shown to be an important player in the maturation process of miRNA and piRNA. Nbr is an exoribonuclease which helps to shape the 3â<U+0080>² end of miRNAs by trimming the 3â<U+0080>² overhang to a final length.              ;
                Results
                In contrast to previous reports on the localization of Nbr, we report that 1) Nbr is expressed only during a short time of oogenesis and appears ubiquitously localized within oocytes, and that 2) Nbr was is not enriched in the nuage where it was shown to be involved in piwi-mediated mechanisms. To date, there is little information available on the function of nbr for cellular and developmental processes. Due to the fact that nbr mutants are viable with minor deleterious effects, we used the GAL4/UAS over-expression system to define novel functions of nbr. We disclose hitherto unknown functions of nbr 1) as a tumor suppressor and 2) as a suppressor of RNAi. Finally, we confirm that nbr is a suppressor of transposon activity.

                Conclusions
                Our data suggest that nbr exerts much more widespread functions than previously reported from trimming 3â<U+0080>² ends of miRNAs only.
              "	"                Drosophila              ;Nibbler;Tumor formation;Nuage"	"In eukaryotes, three main RNAi pathways have received considerable attention in the past: microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering (siRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) [18]. All three pathways reveal difference in their biogenesis, type of Argonaute family proteins, mode of target regulation and substrates [17]. The RNAi machinery and mechanisms associated with it are evolutionarily conserved in most eukaryotic organisms, including insects [42].During the last decade, microRNAs (miRNAs) were found to be important regulators of development, pathology and physiology of plant, as well as humans (reviewed by [22, 48]. Despite their small size of about 22 nucleotide (nt), these RNA molecules exert complex functions by binding preferentially to the 3â<U+0080>² untranslated region (UTR) of target RNAs to block their function. miRNAs are initially synthesized by RNA polymerase II to yield a precursor miRNA of about 70 nt length which are 5â<U+0080>² capped and which are also 3â<U+0080>² polyadenylated which subsequently folds into a structure with a partially-paired stem, a single-stranded loop and a 2 nucleotide 3â<U+0080>² overhang. These 3 features are characteristic for the primary miRNA.As a next step, these primary miRNA are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. There, Dicer, a RNase III processes the pre-miRNA to a 22 nt mature miRNA/miRNA* duplex [20, 27]. Subsequently, miRNA duplexes are assembled in a complex with Argonaute (Ago) to form the precursor RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [11]. This complex formation appears to be uncoupled from the synthesis of the miRNA. It is also within the RISC complex where one of the strands is chosen as the active silencing complex. Finally, the active miRNA within RISC binds preferentially to the 3â<U+0080>² UTR of their target mRNAs which leads either to repression of the transcription or by inhibiting its translation [14].When measuring the length of the end of the 3â<U+0080>² overhangs, it was noted that there was an unusually high heterogeneity within the per-miRNA molecules which was ascribed to a sloppy mode of action of RNase III. This necessitated to postulate the presence of yet another enzyme that would account for the precise outcome of the 2 nt overhang. In 2011, two groups presented Nibbler (Nbr) protein in Drosophila as a candidate enzyme belonging to the class of exoribonucleases which likely represented the missing link [23, 32]. in vitro assays showed that Nbr trims many miRNAs to a 22 nt product, when bound to Ago [23], exemplified on a preferred target, miR-34 [23, 32] which itself exists in several isoforms. In absence of nbr, all smaller isoforms of miR-34 are lost [32], indicating that Nbr has a specific function on trimming miR-34, but it would not exclude that nbr would have a broader set of targets. Interestingly, Nbr was predicted to contain no RNA-binding activity, therefore, it was suggested that Ago would exert this job, and only the binding of Nbr to Ago in an complex would allow to act on miRNAs. nbr flies were first reported to be semi-lethal and sterile [23, 32]. Later nbr flies were found to be viable, but showing accelerated age-related effects [15, 24, 49].Recently, research on the Piwi protein, a protein functionally and structurally close to Ago, and the associated piwi pathway furthered our understanding on the mechanisms of the biogenesis of small interference RNAs [24]. The piwi pathway and the associated piRNAs have mainly been studied in Drosophila. piRNAs are 23â<U+0080><U+0093>29-nt small RNAs expressed predominantly in the oocyte [6, 34]. Concomitantly, piRNAs were discovered as master regulators to repress transposable elements (TEs) in Drosophila as well as in mice, rats, nematodes, and zebra fish [4, 19, 21, 31, 37, 39, 47]. It appears that there are thousands of distinct piRNA sequences present in the genomes of Drosophila [4]. To date, no structural or sequence similarity between the sequences of different piRNAs was found, except for a stronger bias for uracil in the first nucleotide [4]. In Drosophila, piRNAs recognize their targets, which predominantly are mRNAs of TEs through perfect or nearly perfect antisense matching. Hence, interfering with the piwi system may change the activity of transposon which may have deleterious effects on the organisms. piRNAs undergo several steps of maturation including formation of the primary piRNAs which are loaded onto Piwi [28]. As a further maturation process, the â<U+0080><U+009C>Ping-Pongâ<U+0080> cycle, reported to occur in the nuage of Drosophila germ cells [4], amplifies secondary piRNAs and thereby silences targets [12, 43]. Due to the amplification of the piRNAs, it is thought that the process consumes transcripts of TEs, thereby leading to a silencing of TEs. Conversely, interfering with the Ping-Pong cycle has likely the opposite effect, i. e. TE transcripts are present at unusually high levels. This in turn increases the probability of TEs to insert into developmentally-important genes or tumor-suppressor genes which may have deleterious effects such as generating cancer in tissues which otherwise would not happen if the regulation of TE activity was in balance.Given the importance of nbr, little information is available as to the overall function of nbr for development or cellular mechanisms in a broader context. We therefore thought to shed some light onto possible mechanisms. Instead of using classical mutants where information on the function is very limited, we used inducible nbr RNAi and dominant-negative versions of Nbr, and employed the GAL4/UAS over-expression system [3]. Using these approaches, we disclose hitherto novel functions of nbr in (i) regulating TE activity, and in (ii) suppressing tumors. Moreover, we show that Nrb is expressed very early during oogenesis and that nbr is involved in regulating small interfering RNA (siRNA) activity. Taken together, our data suggests that nbr reveals a broader involvement in regulative cellular processes than just trimming specific miRNAs."

              "	"Pear (Pyrus communis L.);Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR);RNA-Seq;Sugar determination"	"Pear (Pyrus spp.), one of the most important and oldest temperate fruit tree species (belonging to the subfamily Pomoideae in the family Rosaceae), has been grown in temperate regions since antiquity in both Europe and China [1]. A large number of pear cultivars are functional diploids (2n = 34). The primary edible pear species are the Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai), the European pear (P. communis L.) and Chinese pears (P. bretschneideri Rehd. and P. ussuriensis Maxim.), which are grown for commercial fruit production. The Japanese pear and Chinese pears are grown in East Asia, while the European pear is cultivated in Europe and other temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere [2].Improving fruit quality has become an important direction of fruit tree cultivation. In fruits, sugar metabolism and accumulation are important factors for fruit organoleptic quality. Sugar, the primary product of photosynthesis and a substrate of respiration, is required for carbon skeleton construction and energy supply in plants [3]. Sugars are known to play key roles in both plant metabolic and defense responses as signaling molecules [4â<U+0080><U+0093>8]. Moreover, soluble sugars (sucrose, glucose and fructose) are important components of fruit taste, directly influencing consumer preferences for fresh fruit [9]. Glucose and fructose take part in cell division, and sucrose is actively involved in differentiation and maturation [10]. It has been reported that the levels and ratios of these sugars differ in various tree species and rely on the major catalytic enzymes in sugar metabolism [11]. Soluble acid invertase (INV) converts sucrose into fructose and glucose [12]. In pear and many other woody Rosaceae plants, photosynthetic products, primarily in the form of sorbitol, are produced by leaves and transported to the fruit and other organs, which leads to the invertase-catalyzed hydrolysis of sorbitol to glucose and fructose [3]. It is well known that environmental factors (such as temperature and light) have a certain impact on sugar metabolism in post-harvest fruit [7]. For example, Wang [13] showed that peach fruit stored at 5 Â°C produced lower levels of sucrose and higher levels of glucose and fructose than fruit stored at 0 Â°C. It is well documented that the accumulation of soluble sugars could be improved by modifying the enzymatic activity of sucrose metabolism of post-harvest lemon fruit after exposure to UV-B [14]. Transcriptome sequencing has become a powerful tool to profile transcriptomes due to its reproducibility, sensitivity, high throughput, low cost and accuracy [15]. Transcriptome sequencing is an effective technique for the acquisition of sequences for new genes and provides opportunities to study specific cellular pathways and gene expression patterns [16â<U+0080><U+0093>18]. In this work, expression data regarding differentially expressed genes were analyzed, and the respective putative functions of the sequences were identified through the described screening process. Our study aimed to provide important information for further functional studies of novel genes of â<U+0080><U+0098>Red Clappâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Favoriteâ<U+0080><U+0099> related to sugar metabolism and accumulation using RNA-Seq technology."

In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), several hundreds of short-culm mutants have been isolated over the years. The objective of the present study was to identify the Brachytic1 (Brh1) semi-dwarfing gene and to test its effect on yield and malting quality.              ;
                Results
                Double-haploid lines generated through a cross between a brh1.a mutant and the European elite malting cultivar Quench, showed good malting quality but a decrease in yield. Especially the activities of the starch degrading enzymes Î²-amylase and free limit dextrinase were high. A syntenic approach comparing markers in barley to those in rice (Oryza sativa L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench) and brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon P. Beauv) helped us to identify Brh1 as an orthologue of rice D1 encoding the GÎ± subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein. We demonstrated that Brh1 is allelic to Ari-m. Sixteen different mutant alleles were described at the DNA level.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Mutants in the Brh1 locus are deficient in the GÎ± subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein, which shows that heterotrimeric G proteins are important regulators of culm length in barley. Mutant alleles do not have any major negative effects on malting quality.

              ;Semi-dwarf"	"Semi-dwarfism is regarded as a valuable trait in cereal breeding, as cultivars with a short stature show increased lodging resistance [6, 25]. Due to the potential agronomic usefulness, many different types of semi-dwarf mutants have been identified in barley (Hordeum vulgare) during the last 70 years. These semi-dwarf mutants have obtained different names since they often have other pleiotropic characters which might have been in focus of the involved research group. The major semi-dwarf subgroups are Brachytic (Brh), Breviaristatum (Ari), Slender dwarf (Sld), Erectoides (Ert), Semidwarf (Sdw), Semi-brachytic (Uzu) and Dense spike (Dsp) [10]. However, only a few barley semi-dwarfing genes have successfully been applied in breeding programs â<U+0080><U+0093> The uzu1.a allele was one of the first short-culm alleles to be used [31] and has been introduced in almost all Japanese hull-less barley cultivars [26]; two different alleles of the Semidwarf 1 gene, sdw1.c (originally named denso) and sdw1.d, are most likely the dominating short-culm alleles in the todayâ<U+0080><U+0099>s European elite cultivars [10]; ert-k.32 was isolated after X-ray treatment in the cultivar Bonus and released as the cultivar Pallas [13]; ari-e.GP was isolated after Î³-ray mutagenesis of cultivar Maythorpe in 1956 and released as Golden Promise [1, 12]; sdw4.ba was isolated after Î³-ray treatment of the Chinese cultivar Zhenongguangmangerleng in the late 1960s and is now probably widespread in many semi-dwarf barley accessions in China through the cultivar released as Zhepi 1 [37, 38].Plant hormones like gibberellic acid (GA) and brassinosteroids (BR) are the major regulators of plant height. It is therefore not surprising that successful â<U+0080><U+009C>Green revolutionâ<U+0080> semi-dwarfing genes can be exemplified by Reduced height1 (Rht1) in wheat encoding a transcriptional regulator with a DELLA domain involved in GA signaling [23], Semi-dwarf1 (Sd1) in rice [3, 28] and Sdw1 in barley [36] both deficient in a gibberellin 20-oxidase of the GA biosynthetic pathway, and Uzu1 in barley encoding the brassinosteroid receptor [7, 9].An interesting mutant, not only in the context of plant breeding but also for identification of genetic factors determining plant height, is brachytic1 (brh1), which was originally identified after a spontaneous mutation event in the barley cultivar Himalaya [24, 30]. Outgrown plants have an upright gross morphology with short leaves, culms, spikes, awns and kernels, and their seedling leaf is reduced in length (Fig. 1). The mutant phenotype is easy to classify at all stages of growth (www.nordgen.org/bgs). In total, ten recessive brh1 alleles have been isolated in a wide range of different genetic backgrounds. One allele was previously classified as ari-i but shown to be allelic to brh1 through diallelic crosses [33] (Table 1). Brh1 was mapped to chromosome 7HS and is inherited in a monofactorial recessive manner [24, 30]. Eight of the ten brh1 alleles are further available as near-isogenic lines through recurrent backcrosses to the two-row spring barley cultivar Bowman (Table 1) [11]. Trait analysis of brh1 mutants in the genetic background of Bowman showed that several brh1 alleles reduce lodging without causing significant yield reduction [8]. In addition, the globe-shaped form of brh1 mutant seeds could also be of potential value; such seed form is generally preferred by maltsters as it is associated with an even germination in the malt house. However, the overall effect of brh1 mutations on malting is currently unknown. Still, when elucidating if brh1 alleles could indeed serve as an alternative dwarfing gene in barley, it is of particular importance to exclude a negative impact of the mutation on malting quality.

                  The aim of the present study was to identify the Brh1 semi-dwarfing gene and to test its effect on yield and malting quality. We show that Brh1 encodes a subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein and mutant alleles of Brh1 do not have any major negative effects on malting quality. Heterotrimeric G proteins transfer signals from receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors) to downstream enzymes (effectors) in signaling cascades [32]. The heterotrimeric G protein complex consists of one GÎ±, one GÎ² and one GÎ³ subunit. Brh1 encodes a GÎ± subunit. This is especially interesting in the view that it was recently shown that barley Ari-e encodes a GÎ³ subunit [35], being orthologous to DEP1 in rice [16]. In addition, barley Brh2 encodes a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, orthologous to TUD1 in rice (Braumann et al. unpublished). TUD1 has been suggested to physically interact with the GÎ± subunit in rice [15]. Thus, within a short period of time, heterotrimeric G proteins have been identified as a key regulator of plant architecture in barley."

Research findings showed that genetic factors were the main causes of schizophrenia and the heritability of schizophrenia can be as high as 80% [2]. It often occurs in young adults with symptoms so subtle that is difficult to identify and diagnose. The psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia specified in the latest [5th] edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is based on symptoms rather than on pathophysiological and biochemical indicators [3]. The main symptoms of schizophrenia can be seen in Table 1. At present, the diagnoses of all mental disorders are based on signs and symptoms, rather than on pathophysiological and biochemical indicators [3]. Psychiatry has thus become one branch of medicine which does not rely on laboratory tests [4].Table 1                      The main symptoms of schizophrenia

Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy] is one of the most widely used grasses on golf courses, with cultivars derived from â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099> or â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifdwarfâ<U+0080><U+0099> particularly used for putting greens. Many bermudagrass cultivars established for putting greens can be genetically unstable and lead to the occurrence of undesirable off-type grasses that vary in phenotype. The objective of this research was to genetically and phenotypically differentiate off-type grasses and hybrid cultivars. Beginning in 2013, off-type and desirable hybrid bermudagrass samples were collected from golf course putting greens in the southeastern United States and genetically and phenotypically characterized using genotyping-by-sequencing and morphology.              ;
                Results
                Genotyping-by-sequencing determined that 11% (5) of off-type and desirable samples from putting greens were genetically divergent from standard cultivars such as Champion, MiniVerde, Tifdwarf, TifEagle, and Tifgreen. In addition, genotyping-by-sequencing was unable to genetically distinguish all standard cultivars from one another due to their similar origin and clonal propagation; however, over 90,000 potentially informative nucleotide variants were identified among the triploid hybrid cultivars.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Although few genetic differences were found in this research, samples harvested from golf course putting greens had variable morphology and were clustered into three distinct phenotypic groups. The majority of off-type grasses in hybrid bermudagrass putting greens were genetically similar with variable morphological traits. Off-type grasses within golf course putting greens have the potential to compromise putting surface functionality and aesthetics.

Interspecific hybrid bermudagrasses (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) are some of the most widely utilized grasses on golf courses throughout tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates due to their desirable turfgrass characteristics of texture, color, and stress tolerance [2]. Putting greens are a vital aspect of a golf course and in 2007 hybrid bermudagrasses were grown on 80% of putting green acreage in the southern U.S. [29].â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099> was one of the first interspecific hybrids developed for putting green use [6, 21].

Ultradwarf bermudagrass cultivars are classified due to their more diminutive morphology (i.e., internode length and leaf length and width) compared to â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifdwarfâ<U+0080><U+0099>. â<U+0080><U+0098>Championâ<U+0080><U+0099> and â<U+0080><U+0098>MiniVerdeâ<U+0080><U+0099> were selected from somatic mutations in established â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifdwarfâ<U+0080><U+0099> plantings [5, 23], whereas â<U+0080><U+0098>TifEagleâ<U+0080><U+0099> was a putative mutant from radiation-induced â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099> or â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifway IIâ<U+0080><U+0099> rhizome [18, 20, 41].

Morphological characteristics such as internode length, leaf length, leaf width, and stolon diameter are of particular interest for classification of bermudagrasses [25, 26, 38] because differences in morphology can differentiate off-types from desirable cultivars [9, 10]. Additionally, Roche and Loch [37] stated that morphological characterization could provide useful information to further research for adaptation and management of different hybrid bermudagrasses. Researchers have used morphological characterizations to compare hybrid bermudagrass cultivars within the â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099> family [31, 37]; however, morphological inconsistencies suggest that molecular techniques are also needed to accurately evaluate hybrid bermudagrass diversity [36].Several methods have been used to explore genotypic differences among off-type grasses and hybrid bermudagrass cultivars. DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF) and signatures from amplification profiles identified contaminant off-types not related to the â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099> family, but could not distinguish mutant off-types within the â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099> family [9]. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) studies determined the genetic diversity among several â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099>-derived cultivars. Studies utilizing AFLPs grouped â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099>, â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifdwarfâ<U+0080><U+0099>, â<U+0080><U+0098>TifEagleâ<U+0080><U+0099>, and â<U+0080><U+0098>Championâ<U+0080><U+0099> into the same genetic cluster despite the grasses having differing phenotypic characteristics [11, 12, 41]. Attempts to use various simple-sequence repeats (SSRs) to identify â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099>-derived hybrid bermudagrass cultivars met with limited success as well [19, 24]. While SSRs identified â<U+0080><U+0098>TifEagleâ<U+0080><U+0099> from other â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099>-derived cultivars and identified polymorphisms unique to â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifdwarfâ<U+0080><U+0099> and â<U+0080><U+0098>MiniVerdeâ<U+0080><U+0099> [19, 24], SSRs are not able to readily distinguish all â<U+0080><U+0098>Tifgreenâ<U+0080><U+0099>-derived hybrid bermudagrass cultivars from one another nor have they been able to identify weedy off-type grasses from standard cultivars used on golf course putting greens. Fig. 1 displays the aesthetic and functional disruptions that off-type grasses in bermudagrass putting greens can create.

                    Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a high-throughput, next generation sequencing method capable of generating large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from species with high diversity [13]. GBS offers several advantages over other molecular marker techniques including the amount data generated and the price per sample [13, 15]. Moreover, GBS allows analysis of a species (e.g., hybrid bermudagrass) for which a complete reference genome sequence is not available. Fiedler et al. [15] identified over 4600 high-quality SNPs in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) using an early draft genome assembly with only half of the assembled DNA contigs scaffolded. Poland et al. [32] used GBS to map over 34,000 SNPs for the Oregon Wolfe Barley (Hordeum vulgare) reference population and 20,000 SNPs for the Synthetic W9784xOpata85 wheat (Triticum aestivum) reference population, both of which lacked a complete reference genome sequence. Based on the robustness of the technique and successful use in other grasses without a complete reference genome [13, 15, 32, 33], we hypothesize that GBS may be able to identify genetic variation among off-types and hybrid bermudagrasses used on putting greens. Therefore, our objectives were to explore the genetic and the phenotypic variation among off-type grasses sampled from hybrid bermudagrass putting greens using GBS and morphological characterization."

It is only through the less scientific writings by or about these workers, and in recent years through recorded interviews with those involved, that one begins to appreciate the traumatic background to much of their work.

To understand the origin and evolution of Brassica amphidiploids, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to unravel genetic variations in three diploids and three amphidiploid Brassica species of Uâ<U+0080><U+0099>s triangle along with Eruca sativa as an outlier.              ;
                Results
                Of 124 Brassica-derived SSR loci assayed, 100% cross-transferability was obtained for B. juncea and three subspecies of B. rapa, while lowest cross-transferability (91.93%) was obtained for Eruca sativa. The average % age of cross-transferability across all the seven species was 98.15%. The number of alleles detected at each locus ranged from one to six with an average of 3.41 alleles per primer pair. Neighbor-Joining-based dendrogram divided all the 40 accessions into two main groups composed of B. juncea/B. nigra/B. rapa and B. carinata/B. napus/B. oleracea. C-genome of oilseed Brassica species remained relatively more conserved than A- and B-genome. A- genome present in B. juncea and B. napus seems distinct from each other and hence provides great opportunity for generating diversity through synthesizing amphidiploids from different sources of A- genome. B. juncea had least intra-specific distance indicating narrow genetic base. B. rapa appears to be more primitive species from which other two diploid species might have evolved.

                Conclusion
                The SSR marker set developed in this study will assist in DNA fingerprinting of various Brassica species cultivars, evaluating the genetic diversity in Brassica germplasm, genome mapping and construction of linkage maps, gene tagging and various other genomics-related studies in Brassica species. Further, the evolutionary relationship established among various Brassica species would assist in formulating suitable breeding strategies for widening the genetic base of Brassica amphidiploids by exploiting the genetic diversity present in diploid progenitor gene pools.

Polyploidy is a natural hybridization process. The role played by hybridization had been debated for over a century and recent molecular genetic studies indicate that hybridization is amazingly occurring in natural population at a high frequency [1]. The reunion of genomes through hybridization and allopolyploidy has been estimated to account for 2â<U+0080><U+0093>4% of speciation events in various flowering plants. Genus Brassica has a very long taxonomic and evolutionary history. It consists of three diploid species viz. B. rapa (2n =20, AA genome), B. nigra (2n = 16, BB genome), B. oleracea (2n = 18, CC genome) and three amphidiploid species viz. B. juncea (2n = 36, AABB genome), B. carinata (2n = 34, BBCC genome) and B. napus (2n = 38, AACC genome), all of which are cultivated forms, five are important oilseed crops, while B. oleracea is used as leafy vegetable. Among them, B. juncea (Indian mustard) represents the most common and widely cultivated oilseed crop, occupying >80% of rapeseed-mustard acreage in India. The relationship between the six major cultivated Brassica species was originally described by U [2], who associated the diploid Brassica species including B. rapa, B. nigra and B. oleracea with the amphidiploid B. juncea, B. carinata and B. napus (Fig. 1). B. juncea (AABB) is an amphidiploid containing diploid genomes from B. rapa (AA) and B. nigra (BB) [3]. B. napus (AACC) is a recent allotetraploid species, obtained as a result of spontaneous hybridization between the diploid species B. rapa (AA) and B. oleracea (CC). B. napus is an oilseed crop in many countries of Europe, Canada and Australia, and is used in industry as lubricant and biodiesel. B. carinata had been obtained by hybridization between B. nigra (BB) and B. oleracea (CC) and is cultivated in African countries. Since their parental genome species were thought to exist in diploid form and in different hemispheres, it became a hot research topic to explore the true progenitors for amphidiploid Brassica species. Further, it is also imperative to find out how their genome got modified during the course of evolutionary process.

                      Uâ<U+0080><U+0099>s triangle showing genetic relationships between Brassica diploids and amphidiploids and the genetic distances based on SSR data
                    To date, the molecular mechanism explaining the origin and evolution of rapeseed-mustard remains largely ambiguous. It is a pre-requisite to dissect the genetic relationships between these diploid and amphidiploids Brassica species. With the arrival of array of DNA-based markers, an impetus has been gained for more precise breeding, now known as molecular breeding, genetic diversity studies, phylogenetic analysis and to various crop improvement programmes [4]. However, except for B. oleracea and B. rapa, whose complete genomes have been sequenced, a very little genomic information is available for other members of Brassicaceae family, particularly for B. juncea, which is a very important oilseed crop in India, in which continuous efforts are being focused to improve several traits by exploring more number of markers, especially SSRs. The genomic evolution of Brassica allopolyploids (Chinese cultivars) had earlier been elucidated using ISSR markers [5]. However, due to lack of reproducibility and dominant nature of ISSR markers, SSR markers are the most preferred to study evolutionary process and genetic relationships. There are a number of advantages of using SSRs as they are co-dominant and multi-allelic in nature [6], offer less expensive PCR-based assay, scorability and high resolvability, and reproducibility, making them as an excellent marker system for determining phylogenetic relationships among closely related taxa.It has been found that the genetic material and its arrangement are highly conserved among closely related species and sequence homology is found among the SSR loci flanking regions of related species [7]. Due to the conserved nature of flanking sequences, SSR markers developed in one species can be employed to detect these microsatellite loci in other related species. Among Brassica species including B. rapa (AA), B. nigra (BB), B. napus (AACC) and B. oleracea (CC), large number of SSR markers have been developed and many of these markers have shown to be applicable within and between different Brassica species. In this study, we evaluated the variation in the patterns of Brassica-derived SSR marker amplification in terms of their cross-transferability and allelic variation across six Brassica species and one related genera, Eruca sativa, and inferred the origin and evolutionary history of Brassica amphidiploids. This work will demonstrate the feasibility of SSR markers in resolving phylogenetic relationships of Brassica species and elucidate the possible donor species of extant Brassica amphidiploids and will also unravel the genomic changes that have taken place during the process of evolution after the formation of amphidiploids. Further the large number of SSR markers, which are reported in this study showing cross-transferability and which can reveal the intra species variability, may be much useful in diversity analysis, making heterotic pools, gene tagging etc. in cultivated species like B. juncea, where the genomic resources are very meager to carry out such studies."

              "	"Schizophrenia, CACNA1I gene, Case-control study, Uighur Chinese"	"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is one of enigmatic, complex psychotic mental disease that characterized by abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality, causing a substantial burden on patients and public expenditure [1, 2]. The lifetime prevalence of SCZ is generally estimated to be 1%, and genetic risks account for up to 80% occurrences [3]. This chronic disorder poses series of typical manifestations resembling auditory hallucinations, delusions, and behavioral dysfunction [4, 5]. A lot of crucial developments in neuropathology, epidemiology, and medications are emerged, triggering better identification of etiology and effective therapeutics. Analysis of the genetic epidemiologic in family, twin, and adoption, the conclusion suggest that hereditary loci for which linkage to the SCZ play a critical role in the development of the disease [6].With the deepening research of gene detection and disease mechanism, CACNA1I (calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 I) has been identified as a candidate gene for SCZ. Recently, a primary GWAS conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium-Schizophrenia Workgroup (PGC-SCZ) has made encouraging progress in identifying genetic susceptibility loci, and the CACNA1I gene is reported as a new locus for SCZ in Caucasian [7]. CACNA1I is located at 22p13.1, spanning about 118 kb genomic region, and consists of 38 exons. This gene encodes Cav3.3 isoform that contains a pore-forming alpha subunit, and the coding product of CACNA1I is a member of low-threshold (T-type) Ca2+ channels [8, 9]. The CACNA1I gene is abundantly expressed in the thalamic reticular nucleus, and delineates the distinctive physiological properties of neuronal firing [10, 11]. There are three subtypes of low threshold voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels have been implicated and designated Î±1G (Cav3.1), Î±1H (Cav3.2) and Î±1I (Cav3.3) by previous reports, which endow typical kinetic features and involve in different signatures of T-currents, respectively [12]. In view of the exploration of the thalamic reticular and relay neurons activities, increasing results point to Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 channels represent short burst firing and small conductance, while Cav3.3 leads to slower activation and inactivation [13, 14].The normal physiological activities of human beings need to be maintained through the action potential discharge of specific ion channels. Ion exchange is responsible for the level of intracellular Ca2+, carry out a series of electrical, chemical, and physical function [15]. Evidence demonstrates that CACNA1I mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in brain regions, and Cav3.3 channel provoked by small membrane depolarization can elicit spontaneous discharge. The channel encoded by CACNA1I plays a central role in the thalamic spindle generator [16], alongside reduced sleep spindles associate with SCZ [17]. Abnormalities of sleep spindles and disturbances in thalamic neurons, are found in people with schizophrenia. It is noteworthy that the encode proteins has been reported can meet the druggable target of SCZ [18]. Moreover, T-type calcium channels have been shown to be a crucial cause of insomnia and neuropathic pain [19]. There is evidence that a single copy of Chr22:39665939G > A CACNA1I triggers calcium channel disorder and is associated with the pathogenesis of SCZ [20]. These profound findings have prompted us to open up promising research idea that CACNA1I might regulates signaling pathways in SCZ.Uygur is one of the minority nationalities in China, and mainly distributes in Xinjiang Province. The region located in the northwest border area of China, and the hinterland of the Eurasian continent. As a part of the ancient Silk Road, the mutual migration between the countries, the typical diets, and the different lifestyles play the important role in shaping the genetic structure [21, 22]. The Uygur populations therefore are results of admixture of Han Chinese and Western Europe [23], and also is the highlight of the current study.To date, there have been no studies that CACNA1I SNPs association with SCZ in the Uygur Chinese population reported, so it is the first study which performed CACNA1I in the Uygur Chinese population. A total of nine SNPs were selected in CACNA1I, including eight tag SNPs which were examined to provide a good coverage of this region, and one positive SNP which identified from a genome-wide association study was selected [24]."

                Results
                Histopathological characteristics of OA cartilage were examined using a rat model of leptin-induced OA. Gene expression profile of leptin-induced articular cartilage and healthy rat cartilage were compared using genome-wide microarray hybridization. A total of 1857 genes differentially expressed genes (1197 upregulated and 660 downregulated) were identified, some of which are known to be associated with leptin-induced OA phenotype. These included genes related to MMPs, inflammatory factors, growth factors, apoptotic genes and osteogenic genes. In addition, upregulated expressions of some new candidate genes, which have hitherto fore not been linked to OA (such as BCL2L11) were detected in leptin-induced OA cartilage, which suggests that these genes might be important for OA molecular mechanism.
              ;
                Conclusion
                Our findings suggest that pathogenesis of leptin-induced OA involves modulation of expression of multiple genes, although the underlying molecular mechanisms need to be studied further. Further investigation of leptin-induced gene expression changes is needed to gain new insights into the molecular mechanism of OA pathogenesis.
              "	"Osteoarthritis;Leptin;Rats;DEG"	"Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders and is the most common form of arthritis among the elderly population [1]. Multiple factors are involved in the onset and progression of OA. Among the OA phenotypes associated with joint failure, such as malalignment, muscle dysfunction, ligament tear, subchondral bone sclerosis and osteophyte growth, cartilage degradation is the most common phenotype [2]. Chondrocytes, which is the only cell type in healthy cartilage tissue, are critical for remodeling and maintenance of the structure and function of the cartilaginous extracellular matrix. Over the last few years, chondrocyte apoptosis and the related signaling pathways have evoked much interest, since it is considered to be the leading mechanism of cartilage degradation in OA joint [3–5]. Although the underlying mechanisms involved in pathological progression has remained elusive, inhibition of chondrocyte death has been suggested as a therapeutic target for limiting cartilage degradation. Furthermore, inflammation is believed to play a critical role in the onset of OA due to its catabolic effect on cartilage [6]. Systemic and local production of inflammatory cytokines, activation of complement and innate immune response are shown to be important in the progression of OA.Obesity has been traditionally considered as a local risk factor for OA due to increased mechanical load on weight-bearing joints such as knees and hips [7]. But the fact that obese individuals are also at a higher risk of OA in non-weight-bearing joints such as hands, wrists and shoulders [8] suggests that additional factors related to obesity may also play a role in the onset and progression of OA. It has been reported that leptin, which is produced predominantly in white adipose tissue, shows significantly higher levels in synovial fluid of patients with OA as compared to that in healthy individuals. This leads us to an epidemiological link between OA and leptin [9, 10]. Since functional leptin receptor is found on healthy chondrocytes [11], it is believed that leptin/leptin receptor signaling axis may modulate synovial joint homeostasis. During OA progression, excessive concentration of leptin may induce metabolic changes in chondrocytes. Moreover, leptin has also been reported to modulate inflammatory factors and catabolic enzymes in cartilage and other joint tissues [12]. Simopoulou et al. reported that leptin inhibited chondrocyte proliferation and increased IL-1ß, MMP-9 and MMP-13 secretion to the synovial fluid. Insights gained from these studies indicate a temporal relationship of leptin with onset as well as progression of OA. Since leptin is a catabolic factor in cartilage metabolism and could be a driving factor in the pathogenesis of OA, intra-articular injection of leptin has been used to establish a rat model of OA [13].High through-put gene expression studies such as microarray analyses are increasingly used to identify changes in gene expression profiles during the onset and progression of complex diseases such as OA. Further, these have also been used to identify biomarkers to aid diagnosis as well as to monitor disease activity and therapeutic response [14, 15]. Several microarray studies have recently been performed to study OA related gene expression, with a focus on cartilage of OA patients [16–20]. These findings can help understand the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in progression of arthritis. However, innate differences between patients, such as with respect to age, and stratification of joints, tend to introduce an element of bias. Therefore, assessment of gene expression changes in response to external stimuli, such as leptin, may provide new insights into the genetic determinants of OA and the signaling pathways involved in its pathogenesis.In this study, we integrated microarray data from articular chondrocytes of rats and sought to identify gene expression profiles and signaling pathways that can mark the pathogenetic changes in OA cartilage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform microarray analyses to compare healthy cartilage and leptin-stimulated cartilage, thereby providing clues to the pathogenetic mechanisms of OA. The results of this study could help identify new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets."

The establishment of a core collection for crops is practical for efficient management and use of germplasm. However, the establishment of a core collection of mushrooms is still in its infancy, and no established core collection of the economically important species Flammulina velutipes has been reported.              ;
                Results
                We established the first core collection of F. velutipes, containing 32 strains based on 81 genetically different F. veltuipes strains. The allele retention proportion of the core collection for the entire collection was 100%. Moreover, the genetic diversity parameters (the effective number of alleles, Neiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s expected heterozygosity, the number of observed heterozygosity, and Shannonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s information index) of the core collection showed no significant differences from the entire collection (p > 0.01). Thus, the core collection is representative of the genetic diversity of the entire collection. Genetic structure analyses of the core collection revealed that the 32 strains could be clustered into 6 groups, among which groups 1 to 3 were cultivars and groups 4 to 6 were wild strains. The wild strains from different locations harbor their own specific alleles, and were clustered stringently in accordance with their geographic origins. Genetic diversity analyses of the core collection revealed that the wild strains possessed greater genetic diversity than the cultivars.

                We established the first core collection of F. velutipes in China, which is an important platform for efficient breeding of this mushroom in the future. In addition, the wild strains in the core collection possess favorable agronomic characters and produce unique bioactive compounds, adding value to the platform. More attention should be paid to wild strains in further strain breeding.
              "	"Core set;Molecular breeding;Molecular marker;Microsatellites"	"A core collection is a subset of accessions that presents the maximum possible genetic diversity contained in an entire collection with minimum redundancy [1, 2]. The establishment of a core collection for crops is practical for efficient management of germplasm. Core collections of most major food crops, such as Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Glycine max and Triticum aestivum, have already been established [3â<U+0080><U+0093>7].A core collection is traditionally constructed based on morphological and agronomic characters using different strategies, such as the constant allocation (C) strategy, the logarithm (L) strategy, the proportional allocation (P) strategy, and the random sampling (R) strategy [2, 8â<U+0080><U+0093>10]. However, most morphological and agronomic characters are quantitative traits that can be easily affected by environmental variation [11â<U+0080><U+0093>13]. Therefore, phenotypic data cannot directly reflect the genetic diversity of germplasm resources [11].Conversely, molecular markers can directly reflect a germplasmâ<U+0080><U+0099>s genetic diversity at the DNA sequence level. Compared with other molecular markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are randomly repeated DNA sequences, generally 1 to 6 base pairs in length per unit. SSRs can spread extensively throughout a genome. They are typically co-dominant, highly polymorphic, reproducible and easy to score [14â<U+0080><U+0093>16]. Based on molecular marker data, Kim et al. [17] developed software named PowerCore by applying the advanced maximization (M) strategy with heuristic searching to establish a core collection (allele mining collection); it allows all alleles to be captured in a minimum number of accessions [17]. It has been successfully used with many economically important crops, such as Oryza sativa, Glycine max, Olea europaea, Vigna radiata, and Sesamum indicum and has been proven to be most suitable for establishing a core collection based on molecular data [18â<U+0080><U+0093>22].However, the development of core collections of edible mushrooms is still at an early stage, and core collections have been established only in Pleurotus ostreatus and Lentinula edodes [23â<U+0080><U+0093>25]. Flammulina velutipes is cultivated on a large scale in East Asia [26â<U+0080><U+0093>28]. China is currently the largest producer of F. velutipes, with an annual production of 2.4 million tons [29]. In our previous study, we obtained 124 strains (110 cultivars from the spawn market of China and 14 wild strains from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hunan provinces), and excluded cultivars labeled with confusing names, then screened out 81 strains that are genetically different [30]. In order to efficiently manage and utilize of these genetically different strains, a smaller representative core collection without redundant strains is urgently needed.In this study, we aimed to (i) establish the core collection of F. velutipes; (ii) evaluate the genetic diversity of the core collection and the entire collection; and (iii) analyze the core collectionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s genetic structure."

                Discussion
                Impressive progress has been made recently to identify genes associated with skin color variation in a wide range of geographical and temporal populations. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about the genetics of skin color variation. We enumerated several cases of skin color adaptation in global modern humans and archaic hominins, and illustrated why, when, and how skin color adaptation occurred in different populations. Finally, we provided a summary of the candidate loci associated with pigmentation, which could be a valuable reference for further evolutionary and medical studies.
              ;
                Conclusion
                Previous studies generally indicated a complex genetic mechanism underlying the skin color variation, expanding our understanding of the role of population demographic history and natural selection in shaping genetic and phenotypic diversity in humans. Future work is needed to dissect the genetic architecture of skin color adaptation in numerous ethnic minority groups around the world, which remains relatively obscure compared with that of major continental groups, and to unravel the exact genetic basis of skin color adaptation.
              "	"Skin color;Natural selection;Genetic adaptation;Modern humans;Archaic hominin"	"Since modern humans ventured out of Africa ~100,000 years ago, they spread across continents into a variety of habitats, from tropical zones to the arctic, and from lowlands to highlands. During migration, selective pressures in local environments (e.g., the cold climate, hypoxia, and endemic pathogens), together with random drift, have resulted in population-specific genetic variants, which further influenced variable phenotypes, such as lactose tolerance, height, immune system, and metabolic efficiency.Skin color variation is one of the most striking examples of human phenotypic diversity. It is dominated by melanin, a pigmentation located in the base of the epidermis and produced by melanocytes. Melanin has two forms, pheomelanin (yellow-reddish) and eumelanin (black-brown). The former is mainly accumulated in the light-complexioned people, while the latter is mostly produced in the dark-complexioned people [1–5]. In addition, the number and size of melanin particles differ among individuals, and is even more important than the proportions of the two forms of melanin in the determination of human skin color [5]. Other skin-related factors, e.g., keratin, also contribute to skin color variation [6, 7].In global populations, skin color is highly correlated with latitude, and fundamentally, the distribution of ultraviolet (UV) radiation (Fig. 1). Populations closer to the equator tend to have dark skin for protection against UV, since overexposure to UV may decrease folic acid levels [8, 9] and cause skin cancer [10–13]. The lighter skin in populations at higher latitudes is underlying selection to maintain vitamin D photosynthesis, which is a UV-dependent process [14, 15].                    
                  Fig. 1
                      Correlation between skin color and latitude (from Barsh (2003) [5]). (a) A map of human skin color distribution. (b) A plot of skin reflectance against latitude
                    Although UV has been assumed to be a driving force for the evolution of human skin colors, understanding the exact genetic mechanism of selection would be crucial to reconstruct human evolutionary history and elucidate the microevolution of adaptive traits. Describing a full picture of regional skin color adaptation in humans would be challenging because it includes not only the genes identified to be under selection, but also the extent to which these genes could explain phenotypic variation, the interactions and joint effects of genes, and the way they react to the external environments. In this article, we reviewed several cases of skin color adaptation in various populations of modern humans and archaic hominins. These cases show the similarities and differences of mechanisms of skin color adaptation across populations, and provide some insights into human evolutionary history.Skin color adaptation in modern Eurasians
                In Europeans, SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 [16–19] are two golden genes related to the evolution of the light skin color. SLC24A5 encodes the NCKX5 protein, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family and regulates the calcium concentration in the melanosome [16]. This gene has been confirmed to affect pigmentation in zebrafish and mice [16, 20]. Especially, the derived allele of rs1426654 in SLC24A5 was found to be nearly fixed in Europeans, but almost missing in populations without any European ancestry (Fig. 2) [21]. A 78-kb haplotype around SLC24A5, which is in linkage disequilibrium with rs1426654, was also identified to accumulate in Europeans [22]. A similar pattern can be observed at rs16891982 in SLC45A2 [23], which has been reported to be associated with pigmentation in several species, e.g., mice, fish, birds, and horses [24–26]. Other variants in this gene, including rs26722, rs2287949, and rs40132, were also shown to be coloration-associated in Europeans [23, 27, 28]. Another important pigmentation-related gene identified in European is MC1R [29–31]. This gene is expressed in melanocytes and plays a key role in controlling the switch from pheomelanin to eumelanin [31]. The pigmentary phenotypes associated with MC1R has been studied in a wide range of animals [32–34]. Many variants have been identified in MC1R, such as rs1805007, rs1805008, and rs3212357 [35, 36], despite its small size (951 bp). Other important European-specific loci include rs1393350 in TYR, rs2733831 in TYRP1, and rs1900758 in OCA2 [17, 28, 37–39]. The derived allele frequencies at these loci are high in Europeans but low in Africans and East Asians, which could be a clear signal of positive selection in Europeans, as indicated by statistical analysis [40].
                      
                    Fig. 2
                        Evolutionary model of human pigmentation in three continental populations. The rooted tree shows the genetic phylogeny of human populations from Africa, North Europe and East Asia, with the colors of the branches roughly indicating the generalized skin pigmetation level of these populations (adapted from McEvoy et al. (2006) [39]). Genetic loci reported to be under positive selection in the common ancestor of modern Eurasians are represented by rs1881227 in KITLG, and those independently evolved in Europeans and East Asians, indicating possible convergent evolution, are represented by rs12913832 in OCA2 and rs885479 in MC1R, respectively. The maps of allele frequency were drawn using R (version 3.2.1, https://www.r-project.org), based on these loci in 53 global populations provided by the Human Genome Diversity Panel CEPH (HGDP, http://www.hagsc.org/hgdp/index.html). Blue and red colors denote the ancestral and derived alleles, respectively
                      
                Genes involved in the skin color adaptation in East Asians are not that well studied compared to the long list of adaptive genes identified in Europeans. Notable examples include OCA2 and MC1R. Each harbors several non-synonymous mutations, e.g. rs1800414 and rs74653330 in OCA2, and rs885479 in MC1R [40–43], which exhibit high derived allele frequencies in East Asians, but low derived allele frequencies in Europeans and Africans (Fig. 2). The OCA2 protein is thought to be a mature melanosomal membrane protein [44], with a potential role in protein transportation into melanosomes [45]. The East Asian-specific variant of rs1800414 was first reported in an exome sequencing study aiming to figure out albinism-related variants [46]. The derived allele at rs1800414 was thought to contribute to the skin lightening in an association study of Han Chinese, which measured the skin color of individuals using the melanin index [47]. Another non-synonymous variant in OCA2, rs74653330, has also been confirmed to be pigmentation-related in an association study of Japanese [48]. Additional examples of East Asian-specific pigmentation-associated alleles include rs10809814 in TYRP1 and rs1407995 in DCT [40, 49], both of which show differentiation between Asians and non-Asians [47], and strong signals of positive selections in Asians [43, 49].
                Despite distinct genes and variants under respective local adaptations in Europeans and East Asians, some genes have derived alleles reaching high frequencies in both continental groups. For instance, KITLG exhibits a selective sweep in non-Africans [50–52]. This gene is widely expressed in multiple tissues, including the skin, and functions in organ morphogenesis and cell proliferation. The Kit-ligand encoded by KITLG is known as the steel factor and plays a crucial role in the normal development and maintenance of the melanocyte lineage in adult skin [53]; this has been proved in human, fish, and mice [54–56]. The effects of this gene on pigmentation have also been confirmed in a series of association studies [57–60]. One of the key variants is rs642742, which is located at 326 kb upstream to the transcription start site of KITLG. At this variant, the ancestral allele frequency is over 90% in Africans, comparable to the derived allele frequency in Europeans and East Asians (Fig. 2). Similar patterns were observed in other genes, e.g., ASIP and BNC2 [39].
                Two models of the evolutionary architecture of human pigmentation were proposed on the basis of the above results and other related studies (Fig. 2). One is a convergent evolution model [17, 40, 43, 49], suggesting that depigmentation has, to some degree, evolved independently in Europeans and East Asians, as different genes and variants have been suggested to explain the light skin and positive selection in these two continental groups. A recent study estimated the time of selective sweeps for the European-specific pigmentation variants to be around 11,000–19,000 years ago, after the divergence of Europeans and Asians [61]. An alternative model fits for the shared selective sweeps of Europeans and East Asians, which could possibly occur in proto-Eurasians. The onset of the sweep was estimated to be approximately 30,000 years ago, right after the “Out-of-Africa” migration, but earlier than the European-specific evolution on pigmentation [61]. The coexistence of these two models suggests a complex evolutionary history of skin color in modern humans.
                Another clue of the complex genetic basis of skin color evolution is the allelic heterogeneity observed in a single gene, like OCA2 and MC1R. In each of these genes, some alleles are specific to Europeans, whereas others are specific to Asians, although they all have been proved to be depigmentation-related. In addition, OCA2 provides evidence of independent sweeps as well as convergent evolution in Europeans and Asians. Since results were obtained from studies using different samples, data, and methods, there could be some confounding factors leading to these different observations. However, more importantly, skin color is a complex trait that could not be simply explained by a single gene or variant; rather, it is likely to involve a huge network of genes and phenotypes. For instance, ASIP, an adaptive pigmentation gene in populations with European ancestry [62, 63], encodes the agouti signaling protein, which blocks MC1R in the eumelanin synthesis in response to the UV-induced DNA damage [40]. In the melanin production, TYR acts as the catalyzer of the key initial step, and its stability is maintained by TYRP1 and DCT.
                In addition, scans for selection on skin pigmentation indicate two different selection behaviors acting on de novo mutations and standing variations, respectively. Some variants, represented by rs1805007 and rs1805008 in MC1R (in Europeans) and rs1800414 in OCA2 (in Asians), only show derived alleles in populations under positive selection at these loci, from which we could conjecture that they are new mutations that appeared after modern humans settled in Europe or Asia. In contrast, some variants, such as rs3212357 in MC1R (under positive selection in Europeans), present low frequencies in Africans. Regardless of possible mutation events and genetic drift in African populations, it is more likely that the derived allele at this locus has presented for some time before they became favored. Similar cases have been found in the high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans and the immunity adaptation in some modern human populations, and even in the evolution of pigmentation phenotypes in non-human species [56, 64].
              Skin color adaptation in the admixed populations
                Admixed populations, the hybrid offspring of two previously isolated populations, may provide important insights in understanding the genetics of geographical variation for two reasons. First, the loci underlying phenotypic differences in ancestral populations are also overlapping the highly informative markers of ancestry, which makes the admixed populations particularly useful for tracing population history. Second, the admixed populations usually have a wide range of variations regarding some specific phenotypes, which may increase the power of locating genes associated with complex traits/diseases after controlling potential population stratification.
                Despite these advantages, admixed populations have rarely been considered in studies of human pigmentation variation. Current studies investigating pigmentation genes in admixed populations mainly involved those with African and European ancestry, such as African Americans, European Africans, and Latin Americans, since their ancestral populations are substantially differentiated in skin color. The ancestral genetic makeups differ among these three populations. African-Americans obtained the largest genetic contribution (~80%) from the African ancestry [65], Latin American mestizos have the least proportion of African ancestry (~10%) [66, 67], while in European Africans, the genetic components inherited from Europeans (~42%) and Africans (~58%) are comparable [68]. Uniquely in the Latin Americans, a considerable proportion of Native American ancestry (~45%) exists [66, 67]. Moreover, on the individual level, the proportion of each ancestry exhibits a large variance in each admixed population. For instance, the fraction of European ancestry varies from 2% to 98% among African American individuals [65]. The large variance of skin color in admixed individuals could result from their highly diverse genetic makeup, as a substantial correlation has been observed between ancestry proportion and skin color [68–70].
                Multiple well-known candidate genes for pigmentation in Europeans have also been identified by admixture mapping (Fig. 3) or association studies in admixed populations. For instance, TYR, carrying a non-synonymous substitution rs1042602 (S192Y), was identified in African Americans [69] and European Africans from Cape Verde [68]. Variants in ASIP, such as rs6058017, which has been found to occur at different frequencies in global populations [63], were also reported to be associated with dark hair and brown eyes in European Americans [71], African Americans [62] and Brazilians [72]. Furthermore, KITLG showed strong signals of selective sweep in African Americans [51], with a significant preference to homozygotes of the African-specific allele (ancestral allele) at rs642742 in individuals with high melanin index (dark skin) [69]. Similar cases include rs1426654 in SLC24A5 in European Africans [68] and Latin Americans [72], and rs35395 in SLC45A2 in European Africans [68].

                However, some studies reported discrepant results. The correlation between Native American ancestry and skin pigmentation reported in a Hispanic population [73] was not observed in a group of Puerto Rican women [70]. One of the key single nucleotide polymorphism loci (SNPs) in OCA2, rs1800404, showed a significant effect on skin pigmentation when analyzing African Americans and a combined population of African American and African-Caribbean, but was absent in an independent analysis of the African-Caribbean samples [69]. It is possible that different genetic mechanisms of skin color variation exist in various populations, but cautions should be taken regarding detailed information in the data, such as sample size and the ancestral populations selected for analyzing the admixed populations, which could lead to biased results [67, 69].
                The identification of genetic determinants of natural variation of skin pigmentation was also conducted in other admixed populations. One successful example is a genome-wide association study of a population of South Asian descent [74], in which polymorphisms in SLC24A5, TYR and SLC45A2 showed significant associations with the melanin content in skin. The light skin alleles in South Asian could possibly be inherited from their European ancestors [75], who initially arrived at this region around 3500–4000 years ago along with Indo-European language expansion [76], followed by recent colonization in the last few centuries. In addition, Central Asia and Southeast Asia are home to various admixed populations, which are likewise of great potential in the study of skin color adaptation. Admixed population analyses may greatly enrich our understanding of skin color variation in modern human populations.
              Skin color adaptation in the aboriginal populations
                The aboriginal populations in different areas around the world have many implications for human evolutionary history. They have been regarded as the early settlers in respective areas. Despite having been assimilated by their surrounding agriculturalists to some extent, some aboriginal people have preserved their traditional livelihoods as hunter-gatherers, as well as their original physical traits – dark skin, short stature, and curly hair.
                The hunter-gatherer populations with dark skin, short stature and curly hair have attracted much attention (Fig. 4a). The genetic mechanism underlying the shared phenotypes among these geographically distant populations (collectively called Negritos or Pygmies), from Central Africa, the Andaman Islands, Southeast Asia and Oceania, are still controversial; for example, whether they were the common descent from a pre-Neolithic substrate of humanity or a consequence of convergent evolution [77, 78]. To date, most genetic studies on this issue have focused on height [78–81]. One study provided clues for convergent evolution from the view of skin pigmentation adaptation by analyzing MC1R diversity in the Melanesians [82]. This study showed that the ancestral haplotypes of MC1R are not highly conserved between Northern Island Melanesians and Africans, although both populations live in the high UV region, which is in contrast to previous findings based on very limited samples [30, 83]. Besides, a non-synonymous polymorphism, rs2228479, shows enriched derived alleles specifically in East Asians, but is not significantly associated with skin or hair pigmentation in Melanesians. Actually, the Melanesian population exhibits striking skin pigmentation variation [84], and consistently, some variants have been identified to be region-specific, which could partly explain this phenotypic variation. A notable example is a non-synonymous variant, rs387907171, in TYRP1 [85]. It is restricted to the Solomons and parts of the Bismarck Archipelago, and might contribute to the ‘blond hair’ in this region [85, 86]. These results emphasize the complex genetic architecture of pigmentation phenotypes, and also highlight the role that population history (e.g., the complex population history of the Southwest Pacific [87–89]) can play a role in influencing phenotypic diversity. Skin pigmentation studies on other modern aboriginal populations (besides Melanesians) are scarce, except for one investigating the Senoi population (an indigenous population) from the Malay Peninsula, which is an admixture of the Negrito (dark-skinned) and the southern Mongoloid from Indo-China (yellow-brown-skinned), and has a wide skin color spectrum [90]. The authors of this study found that despite the low derived allele frequency, the A111T mutation (rs1426654) in SLC24A5 is significantly associated with the light skin in Senoi, which was suspected to result from the admixture of the Mongoloid and South Asians.

                Another interesting issue concerning human skin color adaptation comes from the arctic people. The Inuit people, in far North Eastern Asia and the American Subarctic, have yellowish-brown skin despite the far northern latitude at which they live, unlike other populations living at the same latitude, such as the Swedes and Finnish (Fig. 4b). This makes the Inuit population an exception of the latitude-correlated distribution of skin color. One possible reason is that the dark skin could protect the Inuits from the severe UV exposure because of the long daylight hours in winter and high levels of UV reflection from the snow. While the dark skin is a disadvantage for vitamin D production, plenty of vitamins including vitamin D could be compensated from their diets [91, 92]. Another cause could be the founder effect of the ancient East Asian ancestry of the Inuits, who have inhabited the arctic region since nearly 5000 years ago, and had higher melanin production than the European ancestry. However, very few genetic studies have been conducted to determine the genetic basis of dark skin in arctic populations.
              Skin color adaptation in the ancient hominins
                The dark skin in modern humans was established around 1.2 million years ago, driven by the loss of body hair after divergence from apes, presumably to protect against UV-induced damages [13, 93–96]. Then, when did modern Eurasians start to depigment? The studies on skin color adaptation summarized above are based on modern population genetic data, which may suffer from limited temporal resolution caused by the population demographic history, and insensitivity to selection acting on standing variations [97]. The advent of ancient DNA analyses makes it possible to directly observe the evolution processes, and thus would facilitate our understanding of this key question.
                A study on the genomes of Anatolian Neolithic farmers in West Eurasia (6500–300 BC), who are probably the source population of the first European farmers, suggests that the light skin color has been evolved since at least 6500–4000 years ago [98]. Several popular genes identified in modern Eurasians, e.g., SLC45A2, GRM5 and HERC2/OCA2 showed strong signal of selection in these ancient samples. This conclusion is supported by another study based on the Eneolithic (6500–5000 BP) and Bronze Age (5000–4000 BP) samples, representing the early European farmers or late hunter-gatherers in central Europe [99]. One possible motivation of the skin depigmentation in prehistoric Eurasia is agriculturalization, which led to a switch from vitamin D-rich hunter-gatherer diet to a vitamin D-poor agriculturalist diet, together with the increased danger of folic acid deficiency at higher latitudes [14, 100]. Moreover, the selective pressures have kept operating for a long time after they initiated the adaptation of skin color, as some ancestral pigmentations alleles were identified in a Mesolithic European (7000 BP), and some adaptive alleles under selection in the ancient Eurasians are still evolving in modern humans [98, 99, 101].
                Recent studies on archaic hominins (e.g., Neanderthals, an extinct hominid group living in Eurasia ~400,000–28,000 years ago [102]) further improved our understanding of skin color evolution in modern humans. Neanderthals met modern humans in the Middle East ~60,000–50,000 years ago, and contributed to about 1–4% of modern human genomes [103–105]. Some pigmentation-associated genes are identified in the introgressed haplotypes from Neanderthals in modern Eurasians, such as POU2F3, BNC2 and MC1R [106, 107]. Specifically, the introgressive alleles were reported to result in light skin color, suggesting an ‘adaptive introgression’ strategy of human skin color adaptation. Other introgressive genes related to skin phenotypes include HYAL genes, which are associated with cellular responses to UV and are under strong positive selection in East Asians [108], and those involved in keratin filaments formation [109]. Although these genes are not direct determinants of skin pigmentation, they, like those pigmentation-related genes, possibly helped modern humans adapt to non-African environments.
                When drawing conclusions of adaptive introgression, we are actually claiming that Neanderthals could be light-complexioned. This inference is just based on some pigmentation-associated genes or alleles identified in existing modern human populations, since visible phenotypes of Neanderthals and other extinct species are not available. However, when using some other priory genes as potential clues, different results can be obtained. For instance, the derived state of MC1R, which is responsible for pale skin, presents in Neanderthal individuals from Italy and Spain but is missing in Croatian Neanderthals and Denisova [110], suggesting skin color variation in the archaic hominins. In addition, the light skin in Neanderthals and modern Eurasians could also result from convergent evolution, rather than adaptive introgression [111].
                The hypothesis of adaptive introgression seems to predate when modern human became pale – long before the late Mesolithic age, as Neanderthals went extinct around 28,000 years ago. However, we should reconsider whether the genes affecting skin color in archaic hominins indeed determined skin color in modern humans. Even if this is the case, it is also possible that modern human retained these introgressive variants until they showed some phenotypic effects under some specific strong selective pressures. Thus, more data resources and analyses are necessary to address this issue in the future.
              Selection coefficient and effect size
                As one of the most obvious changes in the environment after modern human migrated out of Africa to higher latitudes, UV has exerted considerable selective pressures on human skin pigmentation, which can be reflected by selection coefficients of the pigmentation-related genes. The estimation of selection coefficients largely depends on the genes considered and the methodologies. Beleza et al. estimated the coefficient of selection at several loci representing SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TYRP1, and KITLG [61]. For example, the estimates are 0.05/0.04 for SLC45A2 and 0.16/0.08 for SLC24A5 under a dominant/an additive model of inheritance in Europeans. Meanwhile, López et al. reported the selection coefficient of a variant in SLC45A2 to be 0.01–0.02 in a South European populations [112]. These estimations are comparable to the selection coefficients inferred directly from serially sampled data at HERC2, SLC45A2, and TYR, ranging from 0.02–0.1 [99]. The selection coefficients estimated for pigmentation genes are best understood in the context of estimates for other recently selected loci. The selection advantages are inferred to be 0.01–0.08 for LCT, a gene strongly associated with lactase persistence in populations with European ancestry [113, 114], 0.019–0.048 for G6PD, a gene conferring malaria resistance in African populations [115], 0.03–0.19 for EDAR associated with the increased scalp hair thickness and changed tooth morphology in the Han Chinese [116], and 0.0004–0.0023 for EGLN1 and EPAS1 gene regions contributing to the high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans [117]. The selection coefficients for pigmentation genes are among the most strongly selected genes in the human genome, indicating a severe selective pressure caused by UV or some other environmental changes in non-African regions.
                Although a large number of genes have been identified to contribute to skin color variation, how much could they explain the skin color variation in modern humans? Is there a gene or variant that has a dominant effect on the skin color? Some genes could possibly play a major role in determining skin color in specific populations. For instance, the light skin variant at rs1426654 in SLC24A5 could explain 22–32% of the variance of the melanin index in South Asian [75] and 25–38% in African-American and African-Caribbean populations [118]. Additionally, the derived allele at rs642742 in KITLG may account for lightening of a person’s skin by 6 to 7 melanin units, nearly 1/5 of the overall skin reflectance difference between West Africans and Europeans (30 melanin units) [56]. However, there are relatively more genes and variants with smaller effects. One of the key variants in OCA2, rs1800414, could explain around 4% of the pigmentation variation in East Asian populations [47]. In South Asians, rs16891982 in SLC45A2 and rs1042602 in TYR account for 3.6% and 2.5% skin color variation, respectively, much less than the effect size of rs1426654 in SLC24A5 [74]. The inheritance mode of skin pigmentation follows an additive model, or at least an incomplete additive model [16, 17, 47, 56, 75].

Augmenting its productivity is a global task of paramount importance. The demand for this crop is increasing at a higher rate than its production, and at the same time there is also a great need for producing it without compromising the environment. Plant breeding, in combination with environmentally friendly production systems with increased efficiency are required to meet the demands [1].
                Wheat yields are constrained by several stresses, biotic and abiotic. To counteract them, plant breeders continuously try to incorporate new resistance/tolerance traits in new cultivars by making use of the inherent diversity of domesticated wheat and also of its related species. One of the most widely used wheat relatives in this effort is rye (Secale cereale L.). Genes from rye have been incorporated in wheat in the form of substitution and translocation lines. Indeed, several studies show chromosome 1R to contribute a yield advantage in wheat (e.g. [2–4]).
                The first attempts to hybridize wheat and rye can be traced back to the experiments conducted by Stephen Wilson, presented in 1873 [5]. Although he considered his results to be negative, he stated that the failure could have been caused by improper methods. The first stable amphiploid triticale (Triticosecale Wittmack) is attributed to Rimpau in 1888, and thereafter more efforts were put into producing wheat-rye hybrids. The advent of colchicine treatment and tissue culture at the beginning of the twentieth century greatly facilitated the production of triticales [6].
                Historically, mainly four rye sources have been used to incorporate rye chromatin in wheat, deployed as (1B)1R substitution or 1BL.1RS and 1AL.1RS translocation lines. The first and most widely deployed source is 1R from Petkus rye. Genotypes with 1BL.1RS translocations were first developed in Germany by Riebesel via extensive crossings between wheat and rye, and such a translocation from Petkus became ancestor of wheat cultivars released in Western Europe, Russia, Mexico, Chile and other countries. From triticale, it is possible to develop wheat germplasm with chromosomes or chromosome arms exchanged for rye chromatin. The other three historic sources for cultivar development were of that kind, developed in Japan, Germany and USA [7].
                Between 1960 and 1990, several hundreds of cultivars with (1B)1R substitution, or 1BL.1RS and 1AL.1RS translocations were released. At the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), 60% of the wheat descendants were 1BL.1RS genotypes during the 1990’s [7]. In China, about 40% of the wheat cultivars released between 1960 and 2000 were 1B/1R translocations with yield gains over the years partly attributed to this characteristic [4]. There are no recent surveys published on the proportion of wheat cultivars with rye chromatin. However, Schlegel [8] has compiled a worldwide list of 2470 wheat cultivars and experimental lines that carry alien introgressions. According to such information and the cultivar listing by the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants [9], we could estimate that there are countries such as Chile in which 34% of the commercial varieties released between 2000 and 2013 carry rye introgressions. In other UPOV countries this percentage is as low as 1–2%, for instance in Russia and Australia. In the USA, according to the database of the Journal of Plant Registrations (http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/pvp/pvplist.pl?) and Schlegel’s compilation, the percentage of commercial varieties carrying rye chromatin is about 15%. These examples demonstrate how the current importance of rye introgressions in wheat varies between countries.
                Partly due to new pathotypes of stem and yellow rusts invading wheat at large scale, in Africa, northern Europe and China, there is renewed interest in using rye as a source for new resistance genes in wheat. Here we compile historic and more recent information on resistance to biotic stresses transferred from rye to wheat.

              "	"Upland cotton;Chromosome microdissection;Microcloning;RGA"	"Chromosome microdissection is one of the most important techniques in molecular cytogenetic research. Specific chromosome or chromosomal sections are isolated using a glass needle or laser under a microscope, and then are enzymatically digested and amplified to construct DNA library of a single chromosome or chromosomal section. Research focusing on a single chromosome or a chromosomal subsection can greatly reduces subsequent work, such as identifying, screening and minimizing the whole genome screening. This technique has been widely used in Drosophila, humans and many other animals since its establishment [1–8] Subsequently, the technique has been widely adapted to apply in herbaceous plants including barley, wheat, rice, and tomato [9–18] and woody plants such as pomelo and poplar [19, 20].Plants have developed defensive mechanisms to protect themselves from pathogen infection through a number of evolutionary processes. The gene-for-gene hypothesis proposed by Flor is based on the interactions between pathogenic fungi and host plants and constitutes the theoretical basis of cloning avirulence genes from pathogens and resistance genes (R genes) from plants [21]. So far, many R genes have been cloned from different host plants using positional cloning and transposon tagging methods. However, considering the large number of physiological races of pathogens, transposon tagging and positional cloning methods are clearly inefficient. Thus new strategies and methods should be adopted to accelerate the cloning of disease R genes. Due to the conserved domains of R genes, homologous sequence amplification or the homologous sequence-based candidate gene approach would be a good choice; actually, these techniques have been quickly adopted by the scientific community. A great progress has been made in recent years for obtaining disease RGAs from many plant species [22–28]. Additionally, some of these RGAs were used as probes for linkage analysis and positioning [22–24, 27].As the primary natural fiber crop, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plays an important role in the world’s economy. However, cotton cells contain large amounts of secondary metabolites, and their chromosomes are small in size and nearly identical to each other. These prevent in somehow to well prepare the chromosomes from the cells and clearly distinguish them from their karyotypes, and thus cytogenetic research of cotton is still lagging behind other plant species, such as rice and wheat. As a typical tetraploid plant species [29–35], there are two sub-genome (A1A1D1D1, 2n = 4× = 52) and high number of nucleotide sequence repeats in cotton genome. There are greater uncertainties in interpreting whole genome while assembling or annotating [33, 34]. Microdissection of a single chromosome or its subsections using direct micromanipulation techniques and gene microcloning through molecular biology should be one easy way to slove this problem. However, currently, there is only one report about single chromosome microdissection that was from somatic cells [36], there is no any report on chromosome microdissection from pollen mother cells (PMC) and on gene microcloning from single chromosome.There are many important genes are closely related to disease resistance, fiber development, fiber quality and yield in the Ah01 chromosome of TM-1 upland cotton [37–39]. In this study, the Ah01chromosome was microdissected from the Ah01 monosome materials derived from TM-1 (a genetically standard line of upland cotton) using the laser method. A DNA pool was constructed from the single chromosome by amplifying DNA using linker adaptor polymerase chain reaction (LA-PCR). RGAs from this chromosome were then cloned."

                Genome sequences of diversely originated plant species were examined for genome-wide motif imperfection pattern, and various analytical tools were employed to canvass characteristic relationships among repeat density, imperfection and length of microsatellites. Moreover, comparative genomics approach aided in exploration of microsatellites conservation footprints in Gossypium evolution. Based on our results, motif imperfection in repeat length was found intricately related to genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites among 13 genomes. Microsatellite decay estimation depicted slower decay of long motif repeats which led to predominant abundance of 5-nt repeat motif in Gossypium species. Short motif repeats exhibited rapid decay through the evolution of Gossypium lineage ensuing drastic decrease of 2-nt repeats, of which, â<U+0080><U+009C>ATâ<U+0080> motif type dilapidated in cultivated tetraploids of cotton.

              "	"                Gossypium              ;Microsatellites;Motif imperfection;Comparative genomics;Evolution"	"Microsatellites are DNA structural elements in which a short sequence pattern (motif) is repeated by various numbers and ubiquitously presented in genomes of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Various mechanisms like replication slippage, unequal crossover, realignment after disassociation of replicating strands, mispairing and base substitution are causative to variations which ultimately lead to extensive polymorphism in microsatellites [1, 2]. Replication slippage events are majorly responsible for extensive repeat length variations, and mispairing of replication strands is key determinant for base substitution in DNA sequence [3]. Moreover, stable wobble mispairing and inefficiency of mismatch repair system could incorporate point mutations anywhere in genome sequence [4]. These processes could impinge on microsatellites and generate repeats with occasional mismatch, motif imperfection, in their repeat units.During the replication process, insertion or deletion in repeat motif units due to reduced strand specificity or slippage errors could generate length variations. Various models comprehend and illustrate the mechanism of replication slippage event [5]. A single unit repeat is inserted or deleted at a time according to stepwise mutation model [6], while repeat unit variations were found associated to a distinct probability distribution under specific assumptions [7]. Similarly, another model proposed generation of microsatellites as 3â<U+0080>² extension of retrotransposons in a way similar to polyadenylation of mRNA [8]; while, idea of probable generation and insertion of microsatellites in 5â<U+0080>² region and inside the mobile elements further extended the model [9]. On contrary, the mechanisms underlying mispairing and interruptions leading to single nucleotide changes are poorly understood [10].Non-coding DNA elements, including microsatellites, also experience various evolutionary forces and show high mutation rates (10â<U+0088><U+0092>2 â<U+0080><U+0093> 10â<U+0088><U+0092>6) in response to selection forces as these usually go unnoticed [11]. Thus, higher mutability and hyper variability of microsatellites could be key determinants of a dynamic equilibrium state in which rapid loss or conservation of non-coding DNA elements exist in species among or within a clade [12]. Various studies reported microsatellite conservation over longer time [13], and recently a study reported conservation up to 450 million years ago (MYA) in vertebrates [14]. Similarly, evolutionary forces might regulate the mechanism which drives fate determination processes of non-coding or coding DNA elements. Thus, conservation and/or deterioration of DNA structural elements over a geographic time period determine impact of species-evolving processes like speciation, diversification, domestication and even duplication through polidization in plant genomes.Non-coding elements constitute a major proportion of DNA in all forms of life and play a crucial role in modulating coding regions of DNA. Occurrence and applicability of microsatellites in coding sequence (CDS) have elucidated their functional importance [15]. Since microsatellites are implied to regulate biological functions [16], mutations in coding microsatellites could be informative and even point mutation might induce deleterious effects. However, our brief understandings about mechanisms underlying motif imperfection, either through base substitutions or point mutation, cause an eminent impediment in this regard.In this report, genome-wide motif imperfection pattern were discerned in 13 plant genomes of diverse origins. The relationship between repeat length and degree of motif imperfection with its impact on the genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites was determined, particularly for Gossypium species. Moreover, evolutionary patterns of microsatellite conservation and/or loss among Gossypium species were also established to ascertain structural consequences of whole genome duplication and allopolypolidization events through evolution of cultivated cotton tetraploids."

                Conclusions
                Our results suggest that the two portions of the gene have been subject to different selective regimes. Purifying selection appears to have been the main force contributing to the relatively low level of polymorphism within the 3â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of the sequence. In contrast, it is possible that balancing selection has contributed to the maintenance of the polymorphism within the 5â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of the gene.

A non-uniform pattern of nucleotide polymorphism within genes may arise if different types of selective pressure are operating on different regions of the gene (cf. [8, 9]). Different regions of a gene may code for peptides that have different structural or functional significances, and the regions of a gene with more stringent structural and/or functional requirements are expected to be subject to stronger purifying selection [10] and, therefore, tend to show lower levels of nucleotide polymorphism than regions that are subject to less stringent constraints [11, 12]. Positive directional selection may reduce the levels of local nucleotide polymorphism within a gene [9], while balancing selection may increase the levels of nucleotide polymorphism at, and in the vicinity of, the selected sites [13, 14]. A classic example of a case where selection results in non-uniform levels of nucleotide polymorphism between different gene regions is that of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. These genes are crucial for the ability of a vertebrate hostâ<U+0080><U+0099>s immune system to detect evolving pathogens, and it is frequently suggested that the maintenance of the high levels of non-synonymous polymorphism in the MHC gene regions encoding the antigen binding site is a reflection of pathogen-driven balancing selection [15, 16]. In addition to selective processes, varying rates of recombination and mutation, as well as stochastic processes, may also contribute to non-uniform levels of nucleotide polymorphism between different regions of a gene (cf. [11, 17]).The PgiC1 gene, which encodes the cytosolic version of the metabolic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI, EC 5.3.1.9), in the grass Festuca ovina L., represents one of the few reported cases in which the levels of nucleotide polymorphism differ substantially between the 3â<U+0080><U+0099> and 5â<U+0080><U+0099> portions of a gene [18]. PGI catalyses the second step of glycolysis [19], and is also known to have diverse moonlighting functions (see the references in [20]). The functional PGI enzyme is formed by two monomers, with each monomer being composed of two main domains (the â<U+0080><U+009C>small domainâ<U+0080> and the â<U+0080><U+009C>large domainâ<U+0080>) [21, 22] (Fig. 1-a). High levels of allozyme/isozyme variation have been frequently reported for PGI in many different species [23]. Observed differences in enzyme activity between PGI variants in a number of species are consistent with observed associations between the PGI variation and environmental variables or life-history traits â<U+0080><U+0093> suggesting that the loci coding for PGI may be under selection (e.g. [24, 25]).

                        Festuca ovina is a perennial, tussock-forming and outcrossing grass, with wind-dispersed pollen and seeds [26]. The species has a broad ecological amplitude and is widespread in unfertilized grasslands in northern Europe (e.g. [26, 27]). The steppe-like â<U+0080><U+009C>alvarâ<U+0080> grasslands on the Baltic island of Ã<U+0096>land (Sweden) are characterized by a fine-scale edaphic mosaic, with moist and dry, and high and low pH microhabitats. Earlier studies suggest that cytosolic PGI isozyme variation in F. ovina may be involved in fine-scale microhabitat adaptation on Ã<U+0096>land [26, 28, 29]. Analysis of replicated samples from different alvar sites shows that, despite the fact that F. ovina is strongly outcrossing, the frequencies of different cytosolic PGI isozyme electromorphs are significantly associated with microhabitat variation in the alvar grasslands and that electromorph frequencies change in response to experimental habitat manipulation [26, 28].In F. ovina, cytosolic PGI is coded for by two loci, PgiC1 and PgiC2 [30]. The â<U+0080><U+009C>nativeâ<U+0080> PgiC1 locus is present in all F. ovina individuals, whereas PgiC2 is only present in some individuals and appears to have been horizontally acquired from a distantly related grass genus [29, 31â<U+0080><U+0093>33]. Earlier analyses of the PgiC1 gene in F. ovina suggest that two PgiC1 amino acid codon sites may be affected by positive selection [34], and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) alleles at these two codon sites show significant associations with microhabitat variables in the alvar grasslands (Y Li, B Hansson, M LÃ¶nn, HC Prentice, unpublished results).The uneven distribution of polymorphic nucleotide sites along the PgiC1 gene was noted in an earlier study that included five PgiC1 coding sequences from SkÃ¥ne, S Sweden [18]. The longest intron (intron 12, Fig. 1-b) was used as a demarcation point between the polymorphic 5â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of the gene and the, substantially less polymorphic, 3â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of the gene. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible evolutionary mechanisms that may have contributed to the contrasting levels of nucleotide polymorphism in the two portions of the PgiC1 gene in F. ovina. We analysed the levels of PgiC1 nucleotide polymorphism within a larger dataset (29 PgiC1 cDNA sequences) from F. ovina individuals collected from the alvar grasslands on Ã<U+0096>land, and carried out a range of tests to assess the relative importance of different types of selection that may have contributed to the non-uniform pattern of nucleotide polymorphism within PgiC1.The 3â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of PgiC1 in F. ovina encodes the structurally important large domain and three functionally essential active site residues (Figs. 1-a and 2). The extensive inter-monomer interaction between the large domains of the two monomers is necessary for the formation of a stable PGI dimer [21] and the three active site residues (equivalent to Glu360, His391 and Lys516 in F. ovina) participate directly in the isomerization reaction of PGI [35]. If the 3â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of PgiC1 codes for products that are subject to greater structural or functional constraints than the products of the 5â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of the gene, then a relatively stronger level of purifying selection (i.e. negative selection) may be expected to have contributed to the low level of nucleotide polymorphism within the 3â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of PgiC1 in F. ovina. The 5â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of PgiC1 contains the amino acid codon sites 173 and 200 (Fig. 2). If these sites are under balancing selection (i.e. positive intraspecific diversifying selection), as suggested by [34], then balancing selection targeting the two sites might be expected to contribute to the high level of nucleotide polymorphism within the 5â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of PgiC1. The present study provides support for the prediction that there is a stronger purifying selection on the 3â<U+0080><U+0099> portion than on the 5â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of PgiC1, and suggests that there is balancing selection on the 5â<U+0080><U+0099> portion of the gene.

To comprehensively investigate the alkaline acclimation mechanisms in P. triloba, a series of analyses were conducted under alkaline stress, including analyses of the kinetics of molecular and physiological changes, and leaf microstructure.
              ;
                Results
                To understand the kinetics of molecular changes under short-term alkaline stress, we used Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to identify alkaline stress-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in P. triloba. Approximately 53.0 million high-quality clean reads were generated from 59.6 million raw reads, and a total of 124,786 unigenes were obtained after de novo assembly of P. triloba transcriptome data. After alkaline stress treatment, a total of 8948 unigenes were identified as DEGs. Based on these DEGs, a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted, suggesting that 28 genes may play an important role in the early alkaline stress response. In addition, analysis of DEGs with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed that pathways were significant at different treatment time points. A significant positive correlation was found between the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results and the RNA-Seq data for seven alkaline-related genes, confirming the reliability of the RNA-Seq results. Based on physiological analysis of P. triloba in response to long-term alkaline stress, we found that the internal microstructures of the leaves of P. triloba changed to adapt to long-term alkaline stress. Various physiological indexes indicated that the degree of membrane injury increased with increasing duration of alkaline stress, affecting photosynthesis in P. triloba seedlings.

                Conclusions
                This represents the first investigation into the physiology and transcriptome of P. triloba in response to alkaline stress. The results of this study can enrich the genomic resources available for P. triloba, as well as deepening our understanding of molecular and physiological alkaline tolerance mechanisms in P. triloba. This will also provide new insights into our understanding of alkaline acclimation mechanisms in Chinese plum (Prunus salicina) trees.
              "	"Alkaline stress;Differentially expressed genes;                        Prunus triloba Lindl;Physiological analysis;RNA sequencing"	"Chinese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) is a small deciduous tree that belongs to the genus Prunus in the Rosaceae family. The wild peach (Prunus persica Lindl.) is widely used as its rootstock in the area south of the Yangtze River in the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan; in the arid area of the northwest district; and in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and other areas in China. While the wild peach possesses the characteristics of high adaptability, developed roots, fast growth, good grafting affinity, and rapid germination speed [1], it also possesses some less positive characteristics. The major drawback of the wild peach is its poor saline-alkaline resistance. When the soil pH reaches 7.5–9.0, iron chlorosis generally occurs in plant tissues. This not only causes plants to oxidize available Fe2+, leading to the precipitation Fe(OH)3, but also influences other iron dissolution pathways and reduces the stability of chelated iron, leading to iron malabsorption [2, 3].The central hill area in the Sichuan Basin is the main planting region for plum trees in China, and it widely consists of calcareous purple soils. The pH values of these soils range from 7.69 to 8.47, and iron chlorosis is common among fruit trees in this area. Iron chlorosis occurs easily in regions with alkaline soil; when fruit trees are under alkaline stress for an extended period of time, they grow poorly, fail to grow flowers or fruits, and may even die, having a detrimental effect on the fruit tree industry [2]. Recently, several methods have been explored for improving saline-alkaline soils [4, 5]. Among these, the selection of an appropriate saline-alkaline-tolerant plant suited to the type of saline-alkaline soil is the main method used to cultivate plants on saline-alkaline land [5]. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of alkaline damage of various plants and to select alkaline-resistant varieties of fruit trees or improve the alkaline resistance of fruit trees. However, the alkaline tolerance of fruit trees is actually dependent on the rootstock alkaline tolerance. Because the rootstock variety directly affects the fruiting time, yield, and lifetime of fruit trees, so the screening of alkaline-tolerant rootstocks is an effective way to improve the alkaline resistance of fruit trees.                        Prunus triloba Lindl., also known as flowering plum or flowering almond, is a deciduous and flowering shrub or small tree species of the genus Prunus (family Rosaceae) native to northeastern, northwestern, and northern China [6, 7]. P. triloba is a popular ornamental plant in China, especially known as an important early spring flowering ornamental in the landscape of northern China. There are many varieties of P. triloba, and it has been cultivated for more than 300 years [6, 8]. It is an octaploid with a karyotype of 2n = 8x = 64, and it possesses the characteristics of good adaptability, tolerance to poorly drained soils and to low level management, tolerance to cold stress and to drought stress, and high disease resistance [6, 9, 10]. In addition, P. triloba is a naturally salt-alkaline-tolerant plant, and it grows well in saline-alkaline soils with a pH of 8.8 (0.3% salt content). P. triloba has good grafting affinity with Chinese plum, bears fruit early, results in high yield, suggesting that it can be used as the rootstock of P. salicina in the middle hill region in the Sichuan Basin [9].A range of abiotic and biotic stresses can severely restrict plant growth and reduce crop productivity, of which soil salinity, alkalinity, or saline-alkalinity are the most common abiotic stresses encountered by plants [11]. These types of soils are widely distributed across more than 100 countries [12]. The salinization of soil is usually caused by neutral salt (NaCl, Na2SO4, etc.), while the alkalinization of soil is usually caused by alkaline salt (NaHCO3, Na2CO3, etc.) and soil saline-alkalinity is caused by the presence of both neutral and alkaline salts [13]. In contrast to saline soil, which mainly affects plants through osmotic stress and ion toxicity, alkaline soil damages plants through high pH [14]. Previous research showed that the negative effect of soil alkalinization on plants was greater than that of soil salinization [11, 13]. While there have been a number of reports on the mechanisms of plant tolerance to salinity [15], much less attention has been paid to the plant response to alkaline stress. Therefore, analysis of the underlying mechanisms of soil alkalinity on plant growth and development are urgently needed, especially for commercial crops.Plant stress resistance is not the result of a single mechanism of action but rather is a complex stress response borne of various aspects of cell, physiological, and molecular biology. The physiological and biochemical mechanisms of plant abiotic stress tolerance have widely been studied by researchers, and the underlying molecular mechanisms have always been the focus of plant biology research area. The molecular mechanisms of plant abiotic stress tolerance involve multiple genes and complex genetic regulatory networks [16]. Only by understanding the functions of these stress-inducible genes can we decipher the related physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance [16]. Of late, emerging high-throughput techniques have become a significant means of achieving this goal. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology is frequently used to study plant stress tolerance because it is an economical, sensitive, and efficient tool for the identification and analysis of key stress-responsive genes. In addition, it can be used for non-model species [17–19].Therefore, in order to comprehensively investigate alkaline acclimation mechanisms in P. triloba, a series of analyses were performed under alkaline stress, including assessment of the kinetics of molecular and physiological changes, and leaf microstructure. The Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform was used to examine the transcriptomes of leaf samples from alkaline-treated or control P. triloba seedlings. We then de novo assembled a transcriptome library of P. triloba to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from plants under alkaline stress. To our knowledge, this is the first physiological and transcriptomic analysis of P. triloba in response to alkaline stress. Our results will enrich genomic resources for P. triloba and deepen our understanding of molecular and physiological alkaline tolerance mechanisms in P. triloba. Our results also will provide new insight into understanding alkaline acclimation mechanisms in Chinese plum (P. salicina) trees."

In the current study, the genetic variabilities present in Kala bhat were estimated using SSR markers and its variability was compared with other improved soybean varieties cultivated in Uttarakhand state, India.              ;
                Results
                Seventy-five genotypes cultivated in different districts of Uttarakhand were collected, and molecular analysis was done using 21 SSR markers. A total of 60 alleles were amplified with an average of 2.85 alleles per locus. The mean value of gene diversity and PIC was estimated to be 0.43 and 0.36, respectively. The unrooted phylogenetic tree grouped soybean genotypes into three major clusters, where, yellow seed coat (improved varieties) genotypes were grouped in one cluster, while reddish brown (improved varieties) and Kala bhat showed intermixing. Population structure divided the soybean genotypes into six different populations. AMOVA analysis showed 12% variance among the population, 66% variance among individual and 22% variance was observed within individuals. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) also showed that yellow seed coat genotypes were grouped in one cluster, whereas, the Kala bhat showed scattered distribution and few genotypes of Kala bhat showed grouping with red and yellow genotypes.

                The different genetic diversity parameters used in the present study indicate that Kala bhat genotypes were more diverse than the yellow seed coat and brown seed coat colour genotypes. Therefore, Kala bhat genotypes can be a good source for the soybean breeding programme due to its better genetic diversity as well as its medicinal properties.
              "	"Soybean;Genetic diversity;SSR markers;Seed colour"	"Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) is an important legume crop which contains 37–42% protein, 17–24% oil and 35% carbohydrates [1], that served as an excellent source of oil and protein for human consumption and animal feed. The wild and cultivated soybeans showed significant phenotypic diversity but the small reproductive difference, and they have very similar genomes in both its size and content [2]. Soybean is grown under varied climatic conditions and geographical locations in India. It occupies an area of 10.8 million hectare and accounting to a production of 11.5 million tone with the productivity of 1065 kg/ha [3]. A potential source of protein and oil makes soybeans a large share in human nutrition, and also improves soil fertility therefore; soybean is also an important crop for research [4].In soybean, evaluation of genetic diversity is enhanced by the use of DNA markers. Researchers have studied the genetic divergence among soybean genotypes for various agronomic traits [5–8] with molecular markers [9–11]. Among different DNA markers, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been extensively used in soybean, each with its own advantages and limitations [12–17].Black seed coat soybean, locally known by different names such as Bhat, Bhatmash and Kala bhat is grown in Kumaon and Garhwal region and in frontiers of Uttarakhand state [18]. In Uttarakhand, these soybean varieties are commonly known as Kala Bhat. It is believed that soybean was introduced by traders via Myanmar from Indonesia. As a result, it has been traditionally grown on a small scale in states like Himachal Pradesh, Kumaon and Garhwal hills of Uttarakhand, East Bengal, Khasi hills and small parts of central India. Kala bhat is also considered as the treasure trove of different medicinal properties. Kala bhat and its products are the richest sources of iso-flavones. Kala bhat, in Uttarakhand is grown in 5734 ha area, with a production and productivity is 5636 tonne and 9.82 q/ha, respectively (Anonymous, 2011). A traditional cultivar of Kala bhat is much low yielder than normal soybean varieties hence this can be improved further by crossing with diverse exotic as well as indigenous germplasm. Morphological characterization of 21 soybean cultivars was done by Oda et al. [19] and 24 Kala bhat genotypes was done by Bhartiya et al. [20].Analyses of the genetic variation and population structure of Kala bhat genotypes are important for their effective conservation and utilization of the valuable genetic resource. The present study was done to estimate the genetic variability and population structure present in Kala bhat cultivated in Uttarakhand state using SSR markers, as the information on the level of diversity present in local landraces (Kala bhat) and population structure had not been studied systematically. The genetic diversity of Kala bhat was also compared with other improved soybean varieties cultivated in Uttarakhand."

However, with the discovery of gene expression waves in vertebrate segmentation, another paradigm based on oscillations linked to axial growth was established. The Notch pathway and hairy delay oscillator are basic components of this mechanism, as is the wnt pathway. With the establishment of oscillations during segmentation of the beetle Tribolium, a common segmentation mechanism may have been present in the last common ancestor of vertebrates and arthropods. However, the Notch pathway is not involved in segmentation of the initial Drosophila embryo. In arthropods, the engrailed, wingless pair has a much more conserved function in segmentation than most of the hierarchy established for Drosophila.

                Results
                Here, we work backwards from this conserved pair by discussing possible mechanisms which could have taken over the role of the Notch pathway. We propose a pivotal role for the large transmembrane protein Ten-m/Odz. Ten-m/Odz may have had an ancient role in cell-cell communication, parallel to the Notch and wnt pathways. The Ten-m protein binds to the membrane with properties which resemble other membrane-based biochemical oscillators.

                Conclusion
                We propose that such a simple transition could have formed the initial scaffold, on top of which the hierarchy, observed in the syncytium of dipterans, could have evolved.

For more than a decade, in attempts to understand sequential segmentation in other arthropods, the paradigm for Drosophila segmentation was used to explain the mechanisms of sequential segmentation. In parallel, other mechanisms proposed for vertebrates emerged, representing an alternative paradigm and being probably even closer related to sequential segmentation [3, 7–9].At nuclear cycle 10 to 14, the Drosophila embryo is a syncytium with nuclei dividing in a layer close to the outer membrane. Since no cell walls have formed yet, protein gradients can arise through diffusion or active transport. Indeed, a hierarchy of such gradients gradually pattern the embryo [1, 2, 4, 10–12]. Maternal gradients from both ends of the embryo determine the locations of the proteins of the next level of the hierarchy, the gap genes. These arise in broad bands, and maternal and gap proteins in turn define region specific cues. At the next level of the hierarchy, the pair-rule genes are controlled by a combination of the gap genes, and the result is the emergence of the first repetitive pattern in the embryo, the seven striped pair-rule patterns of genes such as hairy (h), even-skipped (eve) and runt (run). The pair-rule genes define the final level of the hierarchy, that of the segment-polarity genes such as wingless (wg) and (engrailed) (en), which emerge as 14 stripes, while cellularization is in progress. During this process, a membrane moves from the apical to the basal side of the nuclei and finally encases them.In vertebrates, a completely different mode operates during segmentation. Periodically-arising gene-expression waves, first established in chicken embryos [7], arise from the elongating posterior end of the embryo and run towards the anterior where they gradually stop, thereby adding a segment per period. Subsequently, this was interpreted as an oscillation under control of the chicken Hairy protein. This protein binds to its own promoter and inhibits its own activity, but due to a delay between formation of the corresponding mRNA and the protein, a biochemical oscillator emerges [13]. At the posterior end, cells are converted into the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) during the oscillation mode (Fig. 1). As the embryo elongates axially, new oscillating cells emerge in the PSM with varying phases. Eventually, the period of oscillation of an individual cell becomes larger, until the oscillation eventually stops and segment borders form. This process repeats itself when the next group of cells come to a halt during their oscillation, and thus segments form sequentially (from anterior towards posterior).                    
                  Fig. 1
                      Somite formation in the oscillator-growth scenario. a a vertical embryo is depicted, with anterior head above and posterior tail region below, where the growth zone is located. The presomitic mesoderm (PSM) is the region from the last already-formed somite to the growth zone at the posterior PSM boundary. The time evolution of newly formed cells at the growth zone is depicted in (b) as the horizontal black bar. Initially, a gene expression, depicted as a grey time box, oscillates in time (with a period of three time-boxes, left part of black bar). Eventually (right part of the horizontal bar), the period increases to more than six time boxes, (and even more, see Fig. 5a) and the oscillation thus comes almost to a halt. A bistable system freezes this gene expression in the (almost) stopped phase, somite boundaries start to form and a new mature somite is created, depicted as a circle. Thus somites are added in an anterior to posterior direction, with control from the posterior part of the embryo. Reproduced from [58]
                    How the periodic spatial pattern generated by gene-expression waves are translated into actual somites is still a matter of discussion. The high and low protein concentrations must interfere with a bistable mechanism which is capable of storing these phases. The same problem arises in arthropod segmentation. In Drosophila, the wg, en and (hedgehog) hh module maintains the spatial pattern once formed [14].The essential traits of the vertebrate segmentation paradigm is an oscillator coupled to axial growth, slowing of the oscillation, and stabilization by a bistable switch. Although often referred to as a ‘clock-and-wave front’ mechanism, the original CW-model [15] was assigned a role for the control of segmentation from the anterior part of the embryo. However, a modification proposed by Newman with a clock running in the posterior growth zone, with the period frozen when cells entered the PSM [16], is closer to our current thinking. Indeed, this mechanism may be relatively easy to achieve initially during early evolution. This mechanism would yield almost instantly-formed metameric units emanating from the posterior end. However, if there was an advantage of showing the freezing of the oscillation phase postponed, a control system could gradually evolve to achieve this feature.The Notch pathway was shown to be involved in spider segmentation (a basal arthropod) [17]. This report opened a new door to arthropod segmentation. It was speculated that this mechanism of segmentation may have been ancestral, predating the last common ancestor of vertebrates and arthropods. This argument was further strengthened by the establishment of an important role for the Notch pathway in cockroach and cricket segmentation [18, 19]. Somewhat later, a role for Notch at the root of insects for segmentation of the crustacean Artemia franciscana was reported [20]. However, the reports on the significance of the Notch pathway in arthropod segmentation were recently challenged again [21–23].Recently, further progress in understanding oscillator mechanisms in arthropods was made by the demonstration of the existence of a segmentation clock in the odd-skipped (odd) and eve gens in the flour beetle Tribolium which supports the notion of a clock-based mechanism in both vertebrates and arthropods [24–26].However, a common clock based on the Notch pathway must have been lost in the evolution of insects, as the Notch pathway is not involved in early embryonic segmentation in Drosophila, although it is involved later during development in segmentation of the appendages. Likewise, Notch signaling does not regulate early segmentation in the honeybee, a basal holometabolous insect [27].The role of the Notch pathway was originally described to have a share in the oscillating mechanism, but alternatively, it may function to signal locally between cells, thus synchronizing these [28]. Differences exist between zebrafish, chick and mouse somitogenesis, but the essential feature is an oscillator system coupled to axial growth. An interplay between the Notch, wnt and FGF pathways was established [29, 30], however, recent results indicated that a component was missing in the oscillating mechanism [8, 31, 32].The vertebrate segmentation paradigm introduces another framework for evaluating experimental data of basal sequential insect segmentation which otherwise were interpreted to comply one way or another with the Drosophila paradigm. Notably, some of the gap genes may be involved in axial elongation, rather than defining zones of segments. Truncation may occur [33, 34], but truncation may also be due to misregulation of pair-rule genes. A reinterpretation of the role of gap genes, however, does not give any clear answers [4]. The role of the primary pair-rule genes is quite variable, sometimes revealing a pair- rule function, sometimes a function like segment-polarity genes, sometimes neither of these [35–37]. The wg, en and hh module has a much more conserved function in defining segment borders. The observation that many pair-rule genes also harbor regulatory elements for segmental expression led to the (meanwhile) revised conclusion that the most widely-conserved role of the pair-rule genes may be at the single-segment level, and not at the double-segment level [2, 35, 38].In this context, it is noteworthy to mention that not all insects follow the same mode of segmentation. In Drosophila, the patterns of expression of segmentation genes are established simultaneously in all segments by a complex set of interactions between transcriptional factors that diffuse in a syncytium occupying the whole embryo [39, 40]. Such mechanisms cannot act in short germ-band insects such as the grasshopper Schistocerca where the blastoderm initially comprises only one segment, and the remaining segments are sequentially produced from a posterior proliferative zone. The most widespread mode of segmentation among insects is found in the intermediate germ-band organisms such as Tribolium, where a species-specific number of segments forms synchronously from an anteriorly restricted blastoderm, whereas the other tissues form sequentially from a posterior proliferative zone.The nature of the oscillator which could play the role as a possible replacement for the Notch pathway is still unsolved. We wish to propose an alternative mechanism. To this end, we worked backwards from the wg, en, hh module and searched for genes functionally close to this module which could have a role as a presumptive oscillator and at the same time showing a function in cell-cell communication. We wish to argue that the ten-m gene [41] (also called odz [42]) has many properties which may place this gene in a central role for ancient segmentation, and possibly in arthropod segmentation, as well. ten-m is involved in segmentation in both vertebrates and insects [43]. This gene encodes a large type II transmembrane protein which is bound to the cell membrane. In Drosophila, it is located on the inwards-growing membrane which intercalates the nuclei in the syncytium. A long extracellular part of the protein is involved in homodimerization, and the dynamics of this process has properties which may create a biochemical oscillator. Homophilic interactions of Ten-m on the membrane eventually induce cleavage of Ten-m on the intracellular small part, which translocates to the nucleus. A link between ten-m and zic, the vertebrate homolog of odd-paired (opa), was discussed [44]. In Drosophila, ten-m is not transcribed in pair-rule stripes, rather the mRNA is expressed fairly homogeneous, but after translation the protein forms seven stripes at early gastrulation ([41], Fig. 6). The mechanism for this observation is so far unexplained, but we propose that the internal dynamics of the protein-membrane interactions will set up a spontaneous pattern-forming mechanism, well known from similar biochemical control systems. Interestingly, despite the fact that it shows a striped expression, ten-m mutants show a normal cuticle, however, most ten-m mutants die at the first larval stage [45].The role of the equidistantly-striped Ten-m protein in Drosophila is presently unknown. However, the presence of the stripes during late cycle 14 and early gastrulation is early enough to provide an equidistantly striped pattern, which may complement the broad subdivision provided by gap gene cues.We wish to propose that the oscillatory properties of Ten-m may play a seminal role in arthropod segmentation. Finally, we propose a mechanism by which Ten-m would play an important role in cell-cell communication and in axial sequential segmentation in lower arthropods, by a simple parameter change in the control system to an all-at-once pattern forming mechanism. We propose that such a simple transition could have formed the initial scaffold, on top of which the hierarchy, observed in the syncytium of dipterans, could have evolved."

Enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction, is no longer necessary for obtaining mitogenomic data. Despite the benefits, shotgun sequencing approaches also have disadvantages. They do not guarantee obtaining the complete mitogenome, generally require larger amounts of input DNA and coverage is low compared to sequencing with enrichment strategies. If the mitogenome could be amplified in a single amplification, additional time and costs for sample preparation might outweigh these disadvantages.              ;
                Results
                A sequence of the complete mitochondrial genome of the pupilloid landsnail Orcula dolium is presented. The mitogenome was amplified in a single long-range (LR) PCR and sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies). The length is 14,063 nt and the average depth of coverage is 1112 X. This is the first published mitogenome for a member of the family Orculidae. It has the typical metazoan makeup of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNAs (12S and 16S) and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Orcula is positioned between Pupilla and the Vertiginidae as the sister-group of Gastrocopta and Vertigo, together. An ancestral gene order reconstruction shows that Orthurethra in contrast to other Stylommatophora, have tRNA-H before tRNA-G and that the gene order in the â<U+0080><U+0098>non-achatinoidâ<U+0080><U+0099> clade is identical to that of closely related non-stylommatophoran taxa.
              ;
                Conclusions
                We show it is feasible to ultra-deep sequence a mitogenome from a single LR-PCR. This approach is particularly relevant to studies that have low concentrations of input DNA. It results in a more efficient use of NGS capacity (only the targeted fraction is sequenced) and is an effective selection against nuclear mitochondrial inserts (NUMTS). In contrast to previous studies based in particular on 28S, our results indicate that phylogeny reconstructions based on complete mitogenomes might be more suitable to resolve deep relationships within Stylommatophora. Ancestral gene order reconstructions reveal rearrangements that characterize systematic groups.
              "	"Stylommatophora;Orthurethra;Mitochondrial genome;Gene arrangement"	"A recent increase in the number of sequenced mitogenomes allows for a better understanding of gastropod evolution [1â<U+0080><U+0093>3]. Of the more than sixty mitogenomes that are currently available for Gastropoda, less than twenty belong to the Eupulmonata sensu [4], of which the clade Stylommatophora represents the majority of the terrestrial snails. Although the first stylommatophoran mitogenome was sequenced nearly two decades ago [5], it took more than 15 years before new mitogenomes were added to this group on about a yearly basis, as is the case at present. Complete mitogenomes have been obtained for 18 species of Stylommatophora now (excluding Euhadra and Orcula; accessed 2016-10-17) (Table 1). These include representatives of the superfamilies Achatinelloidea, Clausilloidea, Helicoidea, Orthalicoidea, Pupilloidea, Succinoidea and Urocoptoidea, or more inclusively the subclades Elasmognatha, Orthurethra, the â<U+0080><U+0098>Limacoid cladeâ<U+0080><U+0099>, the informal group Sigmurethra sensu [6] and the â<U+0080><U+0098>achatinoid cladeâ<U+0080><U+0099> sensu [7]. Here we report the mitochondrial genome of a fifth orthurethran species, the first one for the family Orculidae, viz. Orcula dolium (Drapernaud, 1801). It is the type species of the genus Orcula Held 1837, which comprises 13 species featuring ovateâ<U+0080><U+0093>cylindrical shells of 5 to 10 mm height. Of these, O. dolium shows the widest distribution and is ecologically most tolerant. Orcula is common in limestone areas of the Central European Alps and the Western Carpathians and is usually associated with mountainous forest habitats and rocky landscapes. Its altitudinal distribution covers a range from 200 m to 2160 m above sea level [8]. Loess sediments of the Pannonian Basin (Hungary, Republic of Croatia and Republic of Serbia) [9â<U+0080><U+0093>11] and the periphery of the Western and Eastern Alps [12, 13] show that O. dolium was also widely distributed throughout glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene.Table 1                      List of included mitogenomes (accessed 2016-10-17)

                Results
                In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology in orchardgrass. A total of 2,334,889 SLAF tags were generated to produce 2,309,777 SNPs. ADMIXTURE analysis revealed unstructured subpopulations for 33 accessions, indicating that this orchardgrass population could be used for association analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed an average r2 of 0.4 across all SNP pairs, indicating a high extent of LD in these samples. Through GWAS, a total of 4,604 SNPs were found to be significantly (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01) associated with the rust trait. The bulk analysis discovered a number of 5,211 SNPs related to rust trait. Two candidate genes, including cytochrome P450, and prolamin were implicated in disease resistance through prediction of functional genes surrounding each high-quality SNP (Pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.01) associated with rust traits based on GWAS analysis and bulk analysis
              ;
                Conclusions
                The large number of SNPs associated with rust traits and these two candidate genes may provide the basis for further research on rust resistance mechanisms and marker-assisted selection (MAS) for rust-resistant lineages.
              "	"Genome-wide association study;Orchardgrass;Rust disease;SLAF-seq"	"Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) is a cool-season forage grass that is wildly cultivated in all mild, subtropical regions of the world [1]. Due to its high yield, high nutritional value, and shade tolerance, it has become a valuable pasture species in China [2]. However, orchardgrass is frequently infected by rust disease, which leads to low yield and poor quality [3].Several studies on rust disease in orchardgrass have been reported. Tajimi et al. [4] studied orchardgrass clonal lines and found that the rusts of orchardgrass, timothy, and ryegrass were closely related and that stem rust was under the genetic control of orchardgrass. Miller and Carlson [5] evaluated rust resistance in orchardgrass based on both phenotypic performance and a polycross progeny test through phenotypic selection. Yan et al. [6] investigated 242 germplasm resources of orchardgrass for 2 years, finding that 13 accessions exhibited high resistance to rust disease. However, the phenotype of an organism can be influenced by both its genotype and its environment. To better assess the impact of this disease, additional methods are needed to study the desirable genetic traits for these plants.Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have become one of the most commonly strategies for identifying genes underlying complex traits in plants. In model species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, the potential of GWAS to reveal genetic traits has been demonstrated successfully by the functional validation of the accelerated cell death 6 (ACD6) gene [7]. This approach has also been used to develop a precise estimation of variation in traits such as flowering time [8] of Arabidopsis thaliana, leaf architecture [9] of maize (Zea mays), and blight resistance [10] of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).In recent studies on rice (Oryza sativa), several genes that have large effects on traits involved in determining yield, morphology, and salinity tolerance have been identified [11â<U+0080><U+0093>13]. In the past few years, flowering time genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare) [14], the PsyI-AI locus in wheat [15], and the rhg-1 gene in soybean (Glycine max) [16] have been identified as candidate genes [17] through GWAS. Rust disease has seriously influenced plant growth and development, so some studies focus on conducting GWAS to plant rust disease. For example, a GWAS was conducted using 232 winter wheat breeding lines to identify loci conferring resistance to Ug99 that is a new race of stem rust and threatens global wheat production, and 12 loci associated with Ug99 resistance were discovered in this study [18]. A number of 177 oat (Avena sativa) accessions were evaluated for disease resistance and further genotyped with 15,000 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 31 simple sequence repeat and markers to disclose association with disease resistance trait and found five markers were associated with rust resistance [19].Consequently, several reduced-representation sequencing technologies, including restriction site-associated sequencing (RADseq), double digest RADseq, and two-enzyme genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), were developed as cost-effective methods for SNP discovery and high-throughput genotyping [20]. Recently, specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), a more efficient solution for large-scale genotyping, was developed by Sun et al. [21]. This approach involves several distinguishing characteristics: (1) fine-mapping resolution among founders can be performed given a high-density of genotypes; (2) outcrossing reshuffles variation in the founder genomes, providing some control over population structure effects; (3) joint-linkage mapping identifies low-resolution quantitative trait loci (QTLs) across all recombinant inbred line (RIL) families, and this genetic background can be controlled while performing nested associations for fine mapping; and (4) the use of RILs allows repeated measurement of phenotypes on the same lines in common and different environments [22]. This approach has previously been used successfully to perform GWAS [23].SLAF-seq is highly automated due to the development of bioinformatics tools and high-throughput sequencing technology applications. SLAF sequencing methods ascertain the uniformity, efficiency, and density of marker development, and they have been applied in several studies. For example, Li et al. [24] constructed a high-density soybean genetic map to discover QTLs pertaining to isoflavone content that were consistent across various environments; Wei et al. [25] established a high-density SNP map for cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) through SLAF-seq to detect fruit-related QTLs. Additional studies have created high-density genetic maps in order to provide a platform for gene/QTL fine-mapping [20, 26, 27]. These studies showed that SLAF-seq methods are used primarily to construct genetic maps for discovering valuable QTLs; however, for QTL mapping, a large investment of time is needed to establish mapping populations, and the intensive labor required may be a limitation for identification of specific traits. To avoid the limitations of this approach, GWAS is a reliable method used to confirm molecular markers relating to important economic traits. SNP markers that cover the entire genome may be analyzed without the construction of mapping populations [28]. Moreover, several studies have used used SLAF-seq for GWAS [23, 29â<U+0080><U+0093>31].In this study, we use the SLAF-seq technology to perform a GWAS of rust traits in orchardgrass to identify the associated SNPs and predict functional genes. These results will provide a basis for orchardgrass breeding and may be helpful in enhancing rust resistance in orchardgrass."

In Sweden there are a number of local breeds, native breeds which have adapted to specific areas in Sweden, for which efforts are being made to keep them pure and healthy over time. One example of such a breed is the Swedish Gute sheep. The objective of this study was to estimate inbreeding and genetic diversity of Swedish Gute sheep.              ;
                Results
                Three datasets were analysed: pedigree information of the whole population, pedigree information for 100 animals of the population, and microsatellite genotypes for 94 of the 100 animals. The average inbreeding coefficient for lambs born during a six year time period (2007â<U+0080><U+0093>2012) did not increase during that time period. The inbreeding calculated from the entire pedigree (0.038) and for a sample of the population (0.018) was very low. Sheep were more heterozygous at the microsatellite markers than expected (average multilocus heterozygosity and Ritland inbreeding estimates 1.01845 and -0.03931) and five of seven microsatellite markers were not in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium due to heterozygosity excess. The total effective population size estimated from the pedigree information was 155.4 and the average harmonic mean effective population size estimated from microsatellites was 88.3. Pedigree and microsatellite genotype estimations of inbreeding were consistent with a breeding program with the purpose of reducing inbreeding.

                Conclusion
                Our results showed that current breeding programs of the Swedish Gute sheep are consistent with efforts of keeping this breed viable and these breeding programs are an example for other small local breeds in conserving breeds for the future.
              "	"Microsatellite Marker;Effective Population Size;Coat Colour;Pedigree Information;Sheep Breed"	"Gute sheep are an ancient breed from the Swedish island and province of Gotland, belonging to the North European short-tailed sheep group. Both Gute sheep and in general North European short-tailed sheep are characterized in part by their hardiness as well as coat colour and pattern variation [1]. Many of the North European short-tailed sheep breeds are decreasing in population size [1, 2] and have low heterogeneity [3]. However these breeds are unique and their conservation is relevant because they add to overall species diversity [3, 4]. The Gute sheep population experienced a severe bottleneck when polled sheep started to become more popular on Gotland and the horned sheep became rare. Beginning around 1920 the remaining horned sheep on Gotland were gathered by a few individuals interested in preserving the horned sheep. These sheep are the origins of the existing Gute sheep population today (personal communication with Gute sheep breed organizations in Sweden). Nevertheless, Gute sheep, unlike some other North European short-tailed sheep breeds, are not endangered at the moment, although the population is believed to be decreasing in size [2]. Thanks to conservation efforts, there were an estimated 5200 animals in Sweden in 2012 [2]. The first association working with the conservation of the Gute sheep, FÃ¶reningen GutefÃ¥ret, was formed in 1977, and an additional association, GutefÃ¥rAkademin, was formed in 2007. Gute sheep breeding is focused on preserving the breed and not on improving production traits.Gute sheep appear in the scientific literature, having been studied for both coat colour and population structure and genetic diversity. Classical genetic studies from the 1970s took advantage of the coat colour variation in Gute sheep, also then referred to as Goth sheep in English, to study coat colour inheritance in sheep [5]. More recently, there have been population genetic studies which have included Gute sheep [3, 6], but these studies only had a small number of individuals; 20 and 12 respectively. There have been no studies of Gute sheep genetic diversity using pedigree information.The objectives of this study were to estimate inbreeding and genetic diversity of Swedish Gute sheep using pedigree data and microsatellite genotypes to identify; if the population is at potential risk due to high or increasing inbreeding and decreased genetic diversity; and if strategies need to be implemented to conserve the Swedish Gute sheep in the future."

Marker validation is essential for QTL studies, but the cost and workload are considerable when large numbers of markers need to be verified. Marker systems with low development costs would be most suitable for this task.              ;
                Results
                We have tested allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), tetra markers and a genotyping tool based on the single strand specific nuclease CEL-I to verify randomly selected SNP markers identified previously either with a SNP array or by genotyping by sequencing in rice and mungbean, respectively. The genotyping capacity of allele-specific PCR and tetra markers was affected by the sequence context surrounding the SNP; SNPs located in repeated sequences and in GC-rich stretches could not be correctly identified. In contrast, CEL-I digestion of mixed fragments produced from test and reference DNA reliably pinpointed the correct genotypes, yet scoring of the genotypes became complicated when multiple SNPs were present in the PCR fragments. A cost analysis showed that as long the sample number remains small, CEL-I genotyping is more cost-effective than tetra markers.
              ;
                Conclusions
                CEL-I genotyping performed better in terms of genotyping accuracy and costs than tetra markers. The method is highly useful for validating SNPs in small to medium size germplasm panels.
              "	"Single nucleotide polymorphism;Genotyping;PCR-based markers;CEL-I"	"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have become the most widely used marker system for plant and animal genetic analyses. SNP arrays are available for a number of plant and animal species [1] and tools combining SNP detection and genotyping such as genotyping by sequencing (GBS) made the use of these markers in genetic studies feasible and affordable for virtually any organism, including non-model species (recently reviewed by [2]). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses may yield a considerable number of markers that require verification of their correctness and diagnostic capacity to predict a phenotype. Depending on the number of markers to be tested, SNP marker validation can be even more costly and laborious than the genotyping experiment itself.Several assay types are available for verifying SNP markers generated by GBS, SNP chips or similar technologies. Cost-effective commercial SNP assays are available [3], but the cost saving promised by these assays are only attained in routine genotyping, when large sample numbers are analyzed with the same assay. For validation, the number of genotypes used for testing a candidate marker is typically small, and only a few of these markers will be chosen for routine genotyping, while most markers will be discarded. In this situation, the high development costs for commercial assays are not compensated for by their low running costs, making these markers an expensive option for validation experiments. What is more, commercial SNP genotyping tools such as KASP or Taqman assays require specialized laboratory equipment, which might not be available in every genotyping lab, especially not in developing countries. Consequently, for marker validation, simple SNP genotyping tools with low development costs are preferred.Conversion of SNP markers to cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers is often used as a PCR-based method to genotype SNP markers [4], but similar to commercial kits, the method might not be practical for SNP validation. First, only a fraction of SNP markers can be converted to CAPS markers, and second, the restriction enzymes for CAPS assays cause similarly high development costs like commercial assays. dCAPS markers overcome the need for the SNP to fall within a restriction enzyme recognition site and eliminate the limitation that only a fraction of SNPs can be converted to dCAPS [5], but the marker development costs remain high, as a restriction enzyme is required to distinguish the SNP alleles. PCR with allele-specific primers of different length has been proposed as a simple and cost-effective tool for PCR-based SNP genotyping [6]. This method is very cheap and easy to perform, but may be constrained by the sequence context around the SNP, which restricts the options for primer design. Similarly, tetra-primer amplification has been described as an efficient low cost method for genotyping SNP markers [7–9]. This method uses two locus-specific outer primers that asymmetrically flank the SNP under investigation, and two allele-specific inner primers, which produce a larger fragment for one allele, and a smaller fragment for the second allele. The bands of different size produced by one inner and outer primer pair can be easily detected on polyacrylamide or agarose gels [8]. To increase the specificity of the genotyping assay, an additional mismatch base near the 3' end of the allele-specific primers can be added [8, 9]. The method may not work well for SNPs in cytosine and guanine-rich DNA regions, and restrictions for choosing the inner (allele-specific) primers may limit the assay performance and require laborious adjustments and assay optimization [10].SNP genotyping using the single strand specific nuclease CEL-I has been proposed previously [11, 12]. The mismatch-specific nuclease CEL-I is extracted at low cost by ammonium sulfate precipitation from common celery [13, 14]. It detects mismatches in DNA double strands with high sensitivity and is commonly used to identify point mutations in methods known as TILLING and Eco-TILLING [15]. CEL-I was used to genotype SNPs present in mixtures of relatively large PCR fragments (2,000 bp) derived from two individuals after denaturation and re-naturation of the fragments [11]. Previously reported protocols require stopping the enzyme reaction by adding EDTA, or even removing excess salt and concentrating the samples through precipitation, making the method relatively laborious [11].Rice is the most important field crop in Asia and mungbean is increasingly used as a rotation crop in rice production systems. Marker-assisted selection is routinely performed in rice breeding and becomes also popular for mungbean [16, 17]. Therefore, the present case study aimed to evaluate the performance and costs of low cost PCR-based SNP assays on these two crops. We have tested allele-specific PCR, tetra PCR and CEL-I digestion for their capacity to correctly validate the presence of SNPs previously identified in a rice germplasm panel genotyped by a GoldenGate assay, and in a bi-parental mungbean population, where SNPs were identified by GBS. Special consideration was given to streamline the assays to keep costs and labor requirements as low as possible. An ideal assay should have no or only minimal need for optimization, enabling designing and running a large number of assays for validation at minimal effort and cost. Therefore, in this study, no optimization and primer redesign was performed before assessing the performance and costs of the marker assays."

Evidence from genetic studies has revealed the role of genome structural variations, specifically copy number variants (CNVs), in the etiology of SCZ. Nevertheless, the occurrence of CNVs and their relation to SCZ has remained relatively unstudied in the diverse Han Chinese population.              ;

              "	"Schizophrenia;Copy number variants;Han Chinese"	"The role of genome structural variations, specifically copy number variants (CNVs), in the development of mental disorders is a growing area of study. Due to the potential polygenic effects and the capacity to alter gene dosage, CNVs may have dramatic consequences on expression levels and therefore phenotype. Szatkiewicz et al hypothesize that CNV deletions are more severe compared to CNV duplications, due to the loss of function effect [1]. Furthermore, large CNVs are more severe than small CNVs, which affect fewer genes and regulatory regions. Because of their direct impact on gene modification, CNVs play a major role in evolution and have the potential to disturb some genomically unstable areas. For instance, the 1q21.1 region is associated with neurological development and thus could have impacted brain evolution. Therefore, deletion of 1q21.1 could explain the neurological and psychiatric conditions observed in patients carrying this CNV. The larger expression of the genome by brain tissue compared to other tissues explains the rationale for selecting CNVs as likely candidates for modulating psychiatric illnesses. As a result of the cost associated with whole genome sequencing, exome arrays have emerged as a viable option for the detection of both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CNVs. Only protein-coding DNA will be examined, thereby providing an approximate portrayal of the genomic expression. Exome arrays have both confirmed SNPs previously established by genome wide association studies (GWAS), as well as identified novel SNPs associated with a wide-range of diseases. Exome sequencing has been utilized for CNV analysis in the genome analysis of Swedish patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and has confirmed some of the previously determined CNVs from GWAS [1]. Nevertheless, the diverse Han Chinese population represents a major group that has remained relatively unstudied with regards to the occurrence of CNVs and their relation to mental health disorders, such as SCZ. Several previous studies implicated numerous rare CNVs in SCZ, including the 1q21.1 deletion [2], 15q11.2 deletion [3], Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) region duplication [4] and 16p11.2 duplication [1]. These new findings raise fundamental clinical and scientific questions concerning classification of major neuropsychiatric disorders, modes of inheritance, diagnostics, and genetic counseling. None of these CNVs have been investigated in Chinese Han population. In this paper we analyze the exome SNP array data in 476 SCZ cases and 1023 healthy controls taken from southern China for the presence of CNVs, particularly focusing on the four CNVs listed above."

Tomatoes are cholesterol free, rich in fiber and protein, and low in fat and calories. Approximately 80% of the tomatoes produced are used in tomato-based foods that include tomato juice, puree, paste, sauce and salsa [2]. Daily consumption of tomato sauce has been shown to reduce DNA damage in white blood cells and cancerous prostate tissues [3]. In addition, consumption of lycopene-containing foods can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer [4]. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop high-lycopene tomatoes using conventional breeding techniques and genetic manipulation. In addition to lycopene content, new color developments also attract consumers in the fresh market. Tomato fruit color is an important indicator of eating quality for consumers and thus considerable research has been directed towards its characterization and measurement [5]. During the ripening stage, tomato color brightens due to carotenoid, lycopene accumulation, independently or in concert with chlorophyll degradation [6]. Subsequent lycopene accumulation during the final stages of fruit ripening affects color development and the health benefits, both important traits for consumers. In green vegetables and leaves, lycopene is concealed by green chlorophyllic pigments. However, in most fruits, lycopene and other carotenoids are responsible for the bright color development during the ripening stage [7]. Lycopene accounts for more than 80% of the accumulated carotenes in ripe tomato fruits. While Î²-carotene accumulates to a lesser degree, it also constitutes a sizable portion of total carotene accumulation. Both lycopene and Î²-carotene are essential to fulfill the nutritional requirements of a healthy animal and human diet [8].Carotenoid biosynthesis in plants occurs preferentially via the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway rather than the previously assumed mevalonic acid pathway [9, 10]. Although both pathways produce isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), the DOXP pathway [11] also leads to the formation of the plastidic carotenoids phytol, plastoquinone-9, and diterpenes (Fig. 1). IPP is a precursor of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is a carotenoid precursor. Using phytoene synthase (PSY) as a catalyst with GGPP leads to production of phytoene [12, 13]. The phytoene desaturase gene (PDS) converts phytoene to Î¶-carotene. Three isoforms of the PSY gene have been identified in tomato. The PSY1 isoform is responsible for fruit ripening, whereas PSY2 and PSY3 are likely predominant in green tissues and roots, respectively [14â<U+0080><U+0093>16]. PSY1 and PDS genes are upregulated during fruit ripening, while genes for enzymes carrying out cyclisation of lycopene such as Î²-Lcy and Îµ-Lcy are downregulated, resulting in low levels of Î²-carotene during tomato ripening [17]. Our previous report had showed the evidence of CYC-B (Î²-lycopene cyclase) gene expression associated with orange color of fleshy fruit in tomato [16].

                      Metabolic pathways involved in biosynthesis of carotenoids via DOXP route with related genes of tomato. The enzymes involved in the carotenoid synthesis are: DOXP reductoisomerase (DXR), hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate synthase (HDS), hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase (HDR), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene desaturase (PDS), z-carotene desaturase (ZDS), carotene isomerase (CRTISO), lycopene Îµ cyclase (LCYE), lycopene Î² cyclase (LCYB), Î²-carotene hydroxylase (CHYB), cytochrome P450-type monooxygenase 97C (CYP97C), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), geranylgeranyl oxidase (GGRS), chlorophyll synthase (CHL).

Dotted rectangle denote carotenoid pathway, genes analyzed in this work are colored in green and regulatory gene SGR is colored in blue
                                 
                    Another important gene, SGR (STAY-GREEN) associated with color has been identified previously in some plant species [18â<U+0080><U+0093>20]. SGR mutants showed brown color due to carotenoid accumulation and fail to degrade chlorophyll completely at ripening stage [21, 22]. For instance, SGR mutants that have been identified in other plant species (Arabidopsis, pepper, pea, and meadow fescue) displayed green phenotypes due to inhibition of chlorophyll degradation [19, 23â<U+0080><U+0093>27]. Barry and Pandey [30] had reported that point mutation in SGR gene causes loss of protein function and leads to inhibit chlorophyll degradation which exhibited green fleshy fruit color in â<U+0080><U+0098>Black cherryâ<U+0080><U+0099> variety. Flavonoids also play an important role in determining tomato fruit color. Flavonoids primarily accumulate in the tomato fruit peel, and are absent in the flesh, due to a lack of expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes in flesh tissues [28, 29].Because of their importance, our study focused on developing a new tomato fruit color that is enriched for Î²-carotene and chlorophyll content. Thus, our work evaluated the segregation of fruit color and, Î²-carotene and chlorophyll level, in the F1 and F2 populations, developed by crossing orange and brown fruit."

The fruit color of Chinese wild grapes is generally black, and the profile of anthocyanins in Chinese wild grapes is significantly different from that of Vitis vinifera. However, V. davidii is the only species that possesses white berry varieties among Chinese wild grape species. Thus, we performed a transcriptomic analysis to compare the difference of transcriptional level in black and white V. davidii, in order to find some key genes that are related to anthocyanins accumulation in V. davidii.              ;
                Results
                The results of anthocyanins detection revealed that 3,5-O-diglucoside anthocyanins is the predominant anthocyanins in V. davidii. It showed obvious differences from V. vinifera in the profile of the composition of anthocyanins. The transcriptome sequencing by Illumina mRNA-Seq technology generated an average of 57 million 100-base pair clean reads from each sample. Differential gene expression analysis revealed thousands of differential expression genes (DEGs) in the pairwise comparison of different fruit developmental stages between and within black and white V. davidii. After the analysis of functional category enrichment and differential expression patterns of DEGs, 46 genes were selected as the candidate genes. Some genes have been reported as being related to anthocyanins accumulation, and some genes were newly found in our study as probably being related to anthocyanins accumulation. We inferred that 3AT (VIT_03s0017g00870) played an important role in anthocyanin acylation, GST4 (VIT_04s0079g00690) and AM2 (VIT_16s0050g00910) played important roles in anthocyanins transport in V. davidii. The expression of some selected DEGs was further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).

                The present study investigated the transcriptomic profiles of berry skin from black and white spine grapes at three fruit developmental stages by Illumina mRNA-Seq technology. It revealed the variety specificity of anthocyanins accumulation in V. davidi at the transcriptional level. The data reported here will provide a valuable resource for understanding anthocyanins accumulation in grapes, especially in V. davidii.
              "	"                Vitis davidii              ;Berry skin;Anthocyanins;Transcriptome analysis;Candidate genes"	"Grapevine (Vitis L.) is an important economic crop used as table fruit, dried raisins, and for wines or juice. The color of berry skin is an important economic trait for grapes. And it is closely related to the components and content of anthocyanins [1, 2]. In recent years, the profile of anthocyanins in grape berry skin has been widely studied. The anthocyanins are glycosides and acylglycosides of anthocyanidins. The main anthocyanidins found in grapes are pelargonidin, cyanidin, delphinidin, peonidin, petunidin as well as malvidin which is usually the predominant anthocyanidin in most red grapes [3, 4]. However, the kind of anthocyanins exhibits obvious differences in different grape species [5]. In the V. vinifera cultivars, only 3-O-monoglucoside anthocyanins are detected, and just a few cultivars produce pelargonidin-based anthocyanins [6, 7]. In non-V. vinifera species, 3,5-O-disglucoside anthocyanins widely exist, even the pelargonidin-based anthocyanins are also detected [7, 8]. In addition, most V. vinifera cultivars possess acylated forms of the anthocyanins, but some other grape species do not produce acylated forms of anthocyanins, such as V. rotundifolia [9].Anthocyanins in grape berry skin are synthesized via the flavonoid pathways, which has been extensively studied. In fact, the synthesis of anthocyanins shares the same upstream pathways with proanthocyanidins and flavonol derivatives [10]. Phenylalanine is the precursor of flavonoid, which is used as substrate, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumaroyl-CoA synthase (4CL) catalyze a series of reactions to produce 4-coumaroyl-CoA. The catalysis of chalcone synthase (CHS) is the first committed step in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, which can catalyze the synthesis of chalcones [10]. Subsequently, after the action of chalcone isomerase (CHI), the basic three rings of the general C6-C3-C6 flavonoid skeleton is produced [11]. The B ring of the naringenin flavanone can be further hydroxylated by flavonoid -3'-hydroxylase(F3'H) or flavonoid-3'5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) to form eriodictyol or pentahydroxyflavanone [12, 13]. The naringenin, eriodictyol and pentahydroxyflavanone can be modified by the catalysis of flavanone-3ß-hydroxylase (F3H) to form the corresponding dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin and dihydromyricetin, respectively. Besides, the dihydrokaempferol can also be catalyzed by F3'H or F3'5'H to produce other two dihydroflavonols, dihydroquercetin or dihydromyricetin [1]. Then, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) catalyzes these dihydroflavonols to form their corresponding leucoanthocyanidins [1]. In the past, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) used to be considered as the first key enzyme that could catalyze the formation of anthocyanidins [14, 15] and lead the flavonoid flux into the anthocyanin branch. However, more studies showed that LDOX also play an important role in the biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins [16–19]. And the anthocyanidins which are the production of LDOX can also be catalyzed by anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) to produce the substrates for the proanthocyanidins synthesis [20, 21]. The glycosylation, methylation and acylation of anthocyanidins are very important for their stabilization. Glycosylation of the anthocyanidins is the key step to produce anthocyanins which is catalyzed by the UDP-glucose: anthocyanidin: flavonoid glucosyltransferase (UFGT) [1, 22–25]. In V. vinifera, the anthocyanidins can only be catalyzed by UFGT to glycosylate at C3 position [24]. Thus, it is also called 3GT. The S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) or O-methyltransferase (OMT) can catalyze the methylation of the hydroxyl groups at the C3 positions or both at the C3 and C5 positions on the B rings of the anthocyanins [26, 27]. Acylation can greatly enhance the structural diversity and stability of anthocyanins [28]. It is catalyzed by the action of anthocyanin acyltransferases (AAT) [3, 29]. There are mainly two types of ACTs that are classified based on the acyl group donors: the BAHD family using acyl-CoA and the serine carboxypeptidase-like(SCPL) group using acyl-activated sugars [30, 31]. Anthocyanins are synthesized in the cytoplasm but accumulate in the vacuoles. Recent researches showed that glutathione S-transferase (GST), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) were closely related to the transport of anthocyanins [32].As part of the flavonoid pathway, the synthesis of anthocyanins are regulated by a complex regulation at the transcriptional level [4, 10, 15, 33–35]. Generally, the flavonoid pathway of anthocyanins biosynthesis is under the control of Myb transcriptional factors, basic helix–loop-helix proteins(bHLH) and WD40-like proteins, which also play crucial roles in the regulation of flavonols and proanthocyanidins [10, 17–19, 36–38]. The research showed that the bHLH gene, VvMYC1, was characterized as a component of the transcriptional complex regulating anthocyanins biosynthesis in grapevine [39]. In grapes, a series of R2R3-Myb transcriptional factors are related to the synthesis of anthocyanins [40]. The first Myb transcriptional factor Myba in grape was identified and isolated from V. labrusca hybrids [41], and the results suggested that VlmybA1-1, VlmybA1-2 and VlmybA2 transcriptional factors are involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the grape by regulating the expression of the UFGT gene [41–43]. In red V. vinifera grapes, the functional VvmybA1 can regulate the expression of the UFGT gene to promote the synthesis of anthocyanin. However, in white V. vinifera grapes, a retrotransposon (Gret1) is inserted in the 5'-flanking region of VvmybA1 gene to form a non-functional VvmybA1a gene, resulting in the transcription factor losing its function [44]. Subsequently, two other VvmybA regulator genes, VvmybA2 and VvmybA3 have been cloned and identified [45]. The VvmybA1 and VvmybA2 are very similar, both of them can regulate the accumulation of anthocyanins in the grape berries, and the white-fruited grapes are caused by the mutation of these two similar and adjacent regulatory genes [46, 47]. More recent researches suggest that variation in anthocyanins content in grapes is involved with the VvmybA gene cluster [48–50].China is the concentrated distribution area of East Asian Vitis species, which has more than 35 Vitis species [51–53]. In recent years, the research of anthocyanins in Chinese wild grapes has been carried out, and the profile of anthocyanins in Chinese wild grapes is significantly different from V. vinifera [5, 7, 54–56]. Generally, only 3-O-monoglucoside anthocyanins are detected in V. vinifera cultivars, and almost all of the cultivars of V. vinifera are devoid of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins. However, in Chinese wild grapes (such as V. amurensis, V. davidii and V. quinquangularis), the 3,5-O-disglucoside anthocyanins widely exist, and pelargonidin-based anthocyanins are detected in some wild species [5, 7, 55, 56]. The berry color of most Chinese wild grapes is black, except for the white-fruited varieties of V. davidii. The subsequent research found that VvmybA1a gene was detected in white-fruited varieties of V. davidii [57]. The white fruit may be caused by this mutation of mybA1 gene. In order to find the causes that lead to the different profiles of anthocyanins between Chinese wild grapes and V. vinifera, we used the black and white varieties of V. davidii as the materials, and the method of transcriptome analysis to detect the differences at the transcriptional level that might be involved in anthocyanins accumulation of these two varieties."

              "	"Ananas;Genome wide marker analysis;Organelle;Pineapple;Simple sequence repeats"	"The extremely surprising flavour and fragrance of pineapple (Ananas comosus L.) delighted mankind at that time of its discovery by Christopher Columbus and even today. Pineapple, a perennial monocot plant belongs to Bromeliales order, Bromelioideae subfamily and Bromeliaceae family. Pineapple is a tropical plant native to South America, domesticated more than 6000 years ago [1]. At the end of the sixteenth century, pineapple had become pantropical and is the third most economically important tropical fruit crop after banana and mango. Pineapple has become industrial crop during 20th century [2,3]. In addition to fresh fruit consumption, pineapple is used for canned slices, juice and juice concentrate, extraction of bromelain (a meat-tenderizing enzyme), high-quality fibre, animal feed and medicines [2]. At present, gross production value of pineapple is approaching $9 billion due to its cultivation on 1.02 million hectares of land in over 80 countries and annual production of 24.8 million metric tonnes of fruit [4]. Wild varieties of pineapple are self-compatible, whereas cultivated pineapple, A. comosus (L.) Merr., is self-incompatible [5], which provides an opportunity to scrutinize the molecular basis of self-incompatibility in monocots.Over the last few decades, a wide range of molecular markers have been developed and used in crop improvement as molecular markers are helpful in assessing germplasm diversity, testing of hybridity, trait mapping, marker assisted selection etc. [6]. Among all the markers till date, Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) are the most ideal, powerful and reliable markers for molecular plant breeding applications because of their high abundance, co-dominant inheritance and multiple alleles [7]. In addition, BES-SSR markers serve a useful resource for integrating genetic and physical maps [8,9].SSRs consists of 2–7 base pair tandem repeat motifs of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra and penta-nucleotides (A, T, AT, GA, AGG, AAAG etc.) with different lengths of repeat motifs. These repeats are extensively distributed throughout plants and animal genomes. A high level of genetic variation is observed between and within species due to differences in the number of tandem repeating units at a locus which produces a highly polymorphic banding pattern [10] and is detected by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using locus specific flanking primers [11]. Molecular markers are widely recognized as a tool in generating linkage maps [12] as they define specific locations in the genome unambiguously [13,14].There are few valuable software and tools available for SSRs identification and in-silico marker development. Important sources for SSR identification are with benefits from the advanced next generation sequencing technology such as TROLL [15], MISA [16], SciRoko [17], SSR Locator [18] and GMATo [19]. MISA is the most common tool used for SSR identification. Generation of SSR markers have been exhaustive due to the time-consumption, expensive process for generation of genomic libraries and sequencing of large number of clones later to find the SSR-containing DNA regions [20] and labour-intensive. To expedite this task, the traditional methods of SSR markers generation from genomic libraries [21] have been recouped briskly by in-silico mining of SSRs from DNA sequences available in biological databases [22,23] and from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that represent only the coding region of the genome [24–26]."

Balancing selection though negative frequency dependent selection (NFDS) among sympatric haplotypes is a possibility, but direct empirical evidence for this is very scarce.              ;
                Findings
                We extend the previous findings of a multi-generation replicated cage experiment in Drosophila subobscura, where mtDNA polymorphism was maintained in a laboratory setting. First, we use a set of Monte Carlo simulations to show that the haplotype frequency dynamics observed are inconsistent with genetic drift alone and most closely match those expected under NFDS. Second, we show that haplotype frequency changes over time were significantly different from those expected under either genetic drift or positive selection but were consistent with those expected under NFSD.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Collectively, our analyses provide novel support for NFDS on mtDNA haplotypes, suggesting that mtDNA polymorphism may at least in part be maintained by balancing selection also in natural populations. We very briefly discuss the possible mechanisms that might be involved.

The karyotype has already been established for purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea L.), but due to the high similarity in the morphology of several pairs of chromosomes in this species, it cannot be used to identify individual chromosomes in its own complement. The objectives of this study are to develop and evaluate the Giemsa C-banding technique for the purpose of identifying the individual chromosomes in Echinacea purpurea.              ;

                The established karyotype with C-bands showed that all the 11 pairs of chromosomes possessed centromeric bands. Telomeric bands appeared most frequently in almost all the chromosomes with only two exceptions, the short arm of the chromosome 9 and the long arm of the chromosome 10. Intercalary bands were found mainly in the long arm of some chromosomes with only two exceptions, the chromosomes 1 and 2 that had intercalary bands on both arms. The chromosome 4 was the only chromosome where intercalary bands were absent.

Purpurea              ;Chromosomes"	"Purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea L.) is native to North America [1, 2] and has important pharmaceutical [3, 4] and ornamental [5] values. Wild E. purpurea plants are diploids with 22 chromosomes in somatic cells [6, 7]. The karyotypes of Echinacea species have been reported to be quite similar [6, 8]. In 2004, the karyotype of E. purpurea was first established by Qu et al.; it has been used successfully to differentiate E. Purpurea from another Echinacea species, E. angustifoli, based on the difference in the centromere’s position of chromosome pair 10 between the two species. However, due to the high similarity in the morphology of some pairs of the chromosomes in E. purpurea, the karyotype established by Qu et al. [8] cannot be used to identify every chromosome in the species.Ploidy breeding which includes polyploids [9, 10] and aneuploids [11, 12] has been proved to be a feasible method for many plant species. Following the success in obtaining tetraploid E. purpurea by in vitro colchicine treatment of diploid explants (Nilanthi et al. [13], triploid plants were obtained by conventional crossing method between diploid and tetraploid plants [14] while aneuploids were obtained by crossing between diploid and triploid plants (unpublished results). To obtain aneuploid in E. purpurea seems easy because aneuploid individuals are known to exist naturally in Asteraceae [15, 16], the family to which E. purpurea belongs. Aneuploids are different from euploids based on the possession of more or less number of chromosomes and are a unique germplasm resource for genetic studies [17–19]. Before an effective study can take place, clarification of the constitution of the chromosomes in the material aneuploid is a prerequisite.Similarity in morphology among some pairs of chromosomes in cells seems a common feature in many plant species. In order to distinguish individual chromosomes from each other in the complement, many chromosome banding techniques such as C-banding [20], G-banding [21], N-banding [22], Q-banding [20, 23] and R-banding [24] have been attempted. Among these banding techniques, C-banding staining of the constitutive heterochromatin of the chromosomes with Giemsa is the most frequently used one in a range of plant species [25–28]. In this report, we describe an effective karyotype based on chromosome length, arm ratio, and the C-banding patterns for identifying individual chromosomes in E. purpurea."

This animal model is also used to investigate how neonatal lesions may alter the genetic expression of dopaminergic receptors. The present study compares mRNA expression levels of dopamine receptors (drd2 and drd3) in lymphocytes and brain of NLVH animals at two different age stages: young and adult.              ;                Methods
                The NLVH procedure was performed on 20 male Wistar rats at postnatal days 5â<U+0080><U+0093>7. The mRNA expression levels of drd2 and drd3 genes in lymphocytes, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were measured and analyzed at postnatal days 45 and 90. The results were compared and contrasted with respective sham groups.
              ;
                Results
                In lymphocytes, only in NLVH-adult group we observed drd2 mRNA expression, while drd2 mRNA expression was not observed in the NLVH-juvenile rats; on the other hand, the drd3 mRNA expression did not show significant statistical differences. In hippocampus no differences were observed between drd2 mRNA or drd3 mRNA expression when comparing juvenile/adult shams with NLVH groups. In the prefrontal area, a decrease in drd2 mRNA expression levels were observed in the NLVH-adult group (F(1,3)â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>52.83, pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0,005) in comparison to the sham-adult group. Finally, in the nucleus accumbens, a strong decrease of drd3 mRNA expression was observed in the NLVH-adult group in comparison to the sham-adult group (F(1,3)â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>123,2, pâ<U+0080><U+0089><â<U+0080><U+0089>0.001).
              ;
                Conclusions
                Our results show that differences in drd2 and drd3 mRNA levels in NLVH-adults are patent when compared to the sham-adult group or with the NLVH-juvenile group. These findings suggest that the expression levels may be regulated during adulthood, leading to behavioral and neurochemical changes related to schizophrenia. Therefore, more studies are necessary to determine the role of dopamine receptors as possible molecular markers for neurodevelopmental changes associated with schizophrenia.
              "	"NLVH;Peripheral lymphocyte;Dopamine expression"	"Schizophrenia is a mental illness which causes a heavy economic burden to society; it affects 1 % of the world population, and it usually develops during the reproductive stage of the person and remains present throughout his/her life [1, 2]. The difficulties to obtain adequate human brain-samples and the increasing necessity to study schizophrenia have led to the development of several animal models. These animal models can be divided into three categories: pharmacological models, genetic models (induced genetic mutations or deletions) and neurodevelopmental models (induced by a natural or neurotoxic injury or by environmental factors during neurodevelopment) [3â<U+0080><U+0093>5].The neonatal lesion in the ventral hippocampus (NLVH) model in animals is based on a neurodevelopmental hypothesis implicating that at an early age (probably during the prenatal stage) fundamental alterations may induce the occurrence of schizophrenia [6â<U+0080><U+0093>8]. For instance, Tseng et al. (2009) suggest that NLVH disrupts the dorso-lateral cortical morphogenesis, since these authors observed that the dopaminergic pathway sets off from the ventral hippocampus to the dorso-lateral area in rat embryos [9]. This effect is more evident in young rats whereas during adolescence rats lose the drd2 modulation in cortical interneurons, as well as the onset of cortical maturation [10]. These findings increase the possibility that maturation of local inhibitory circuits within the PFC may be caused by NLVH [11]. In mental diseases, particularly those treated with antipsychotic medication (including schizophrenia), dopaminergic receptors are of particular interest [3, 4]. The gene expression of dopamine receptors has been directly studied in the brain, and it has also been monitored in other cell populations such as lymphocytes [12]. Therefore, peripheral dopamine receptors may serve as representative markers for changes occurring within the central nervous system associated with neuropsychiatric syndromes such as depression and schizophrenia [13].There are various hypotheses trying to explain the impairment in dopamine transmission [14]. This monoamine dysfunction may be due to immune-inflammatory or neuroendocrine causes or to neuroplasticity malfunctioning [15]. Some authors ascertain that dopamine can directly affect the immune system. They suggest that further research on animal models must address not only the effects of dopaminergic substances on peripheral expression of dopamine receptors, but also the correlation between the regulation of central and peripheral dopamine receptors [16, 17]. To explore this possibility the present study compares mRNA expression of dopamine receptors (drd2 and drd3) in lymphocytes and in some areas of rat brain with NLVH at two different age periods: young and adult."

Sugar beet is known to be recalcitrant for dedifferentiation and plant regeneration. These difficulties were major obstacles for obtaining transgenic sugar beets through an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation procedure. The sugar beet line â<U+0080><U+0098>NK-219mm-Oâ<U+0080><U+0099> is an exceptional line that forms callus efficiently and is easy to regenerate, but the inheritance of these characters was unknown. Another concern was whether these characters could coexist with an annual habitat that makes it possible to breed short life-cycle sugar beet suitable for molecular genetic analysis.              ;
                Findings
                Five sugar beet lines including NK-219mm-O were crossed with each other and subjected to in vitro culture to form callus. F1s with a NK-219mm-O background generally formed callus efficiently compared to the others, indicating that efficient callus formation is heritable. The regeneration potential was examined based on the phenotypes of calli after placement on regeneration medium. Five phenotypes were observed, of which two phenotypes regenerated shoots or somatic embryo-like structures. Vascular differentiation was evident in regenerable calli, whereas non-regenerable calli lacked normally developed vascular tissues. In a half-diallel cross, the callus-formation efficiency and the regeneration potential of reciprocal F1s progeny having a NK-219mm-O background were high. Finally, we crossed NK-219mm-O with an annual line that had a poor in vitro performance. The callus-formation efficiency and the regeneration potential of reciprocal F1 were high. The regenerated plants showed an annual habitat.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Efficient callus formation and the high plant regeneration potential of NK-219mm-O were inherited and expressed in the F1. The annual habitat does not impair these high in vitro performances.

Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequencing provides a high-resolution approach for accurately relating isolates to one another, allowing precise identification or exclusion of transmission events and sources for nearly all cases. We sequenced 24 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) genomes to retrospectively investigate a suspected point source of three surgical site infections (SSIs) that occurred over a one-year period. The source of transmission was believed to be a surgical team member colonized with MRSA, involved in all surgeries preceding the SSI cases, who was subsequently decolonized. Genetic relatedness among isolates was determined using whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data.              ;
                Results
                Whole genome SNP typing (WGST) revealed 283 informative SNPs between the surgical team memberâ<U+0080><U+0099>s isolate and the closest SSI isolate. The second isolate was 286 and the third was thousands of SNPs different, indicating the nasal carriage strain from the surgical team member was not the source of the SSIs. Given the mutation rates estimated for S. aureus, none of the SSI isolates share a common ancestor within the past 16 years, further discounting any common point source for these infections. The decolonization procedures and resources spent on the point source infection control could have been prevented if WGST was performed at the time of the suspected transmission, instead of retrospectively.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Whole genome sequence analysis is an ideal method to exclude isolates involved in transmission events and nosocomial outbreaks, and coupling this method with epidemiological data can determine if a transmission event occurred. These methods promise to direct infection control resources more appropriately.
              "	"Nasal carriage;Surgical site infections;MRSA;Transmission;Whole genome sequencing"	"Surgical site infections (SSIs) account for 31 % of all healthcare-associated infections in the United States [1]. A critical risk factor for the development of a SSI is the severity of wound contamination during surgery [2, 3]. As one of the most predominant organisms colonizing the skin, Staphylococcus aureus is a common causative agent of SSI [4], and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounts for 15 % of reported SSIs [5]. The most significantly associated independent circumstance for the development of a S. aureus SSI is nasal carriage by the patient [3]. Studies that examined perioperative decolonization of patients using intranasal mupirocin showed a significant decrease in the risk of developing a SSI [6â<U+0080><U+0093>8]. The risk of a S. aureus SSI associated with S. aureus nasal carriage or colonization of surgical team members is unknown.The implementation of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in the clinical setting to closely analyze isolates has allowed for precise identification and characterization of putative transmission events among patients. WGS also allows for high resolution analysis of source tracing in hospitals which can have the potential to impact hospital-based outbreak investigations and infection prevention practices [9â<U+0080><U+0093>12]. To our knowledge, however, no study has investigated MRSA carriage among surgical staff members as a source of MRSA transmission to surgical patients using WGST.In this study, a hospital infection control team identified a cluster of MRSA SSIs from a single surgical team. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles suggested that the cases were related. The surgical team in question was screened for nasal carriage by the infection control team and one member tested positive for MRSA by PCR, as well as by culture. The surgical team member was decolonized per hospital protocol, and the MRSA decolonization was documented as successful, based on further nasal screening. In this study, we retrospectively examine the MRSA strain from the colonized surgical team member along with patient and control strains to determine whether it was the source of the cluster of SSIs using whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing (WGST) [13â<U+0080><U+0093>15]. These results demonstrate the utility of WGST for hospital molecular epidemiology and provide confirmation that the source of infection for three patients was not related to the surgical team member isolate."

The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of A. solani populations from different potato growing regions in south-eastern Sweden using AFLP marker analysis. In addition, the cultured isolates were examined for substitutions in the gene encoding cytochrome b, associated with loss of sensitivity against QoI fungicides.              ;
                Results
                Nei's gene diversity index for the Swedish populations of A. solani revealed a gene diversity of up to 0.20. Also genetic differentiation was observed among populations of A. solani from different locations in south-eastern Sweden. The mitochondrial genotype of the isolates of A. solani was determined and both known genotypes, GI (genotype 1) and GII (genotype 2), were found among the isolates. The occurrence of the F129L substitution associated with a loss of sensitivity to strobilurins was confirmed among the GII isolates. In vitro conidial germination tests verified that isolates containing the F129L substitution had reduced sensitivity to azoxystrobin and, at a lower extent, to pyraclostrobin.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Genetic diversity was relatively high among isolates of A. solani in south-eastern part of Sweden. F129L substitutions, leading to reduced sensitivity to strobilurins, have been established in field populations, which may have implications for the future efficacy of QoI fungicides.
              "	"AFLP;Early blight;Potato;Strobilurin;Sensitivity"	"Several fungal species within the genus Alternaria are known as destructive plant pathogens [1] causing severe damage leading to economic losses for growers. Alternaria solani is an asexual plant pathogenic species that causes early blight on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), and other members of the Solanaceae family. The disease may result in large crop losses in many potato and tomato producing areas worldwide [2]. The pathogen mostly infects the foliage and produces dark brown lesions with concentric rings that enlarge, coalesce and eventually cause leaf death [3]. The fungus may also infect tubers during storage in some areas, but relatively little research has been carried out on tuber diseases caused by Alternaria sp. [4, 5].Early blight is a common fungal disease in Swedish potato fields and during the last decade a number of reports have stressed that the disease is an increasing problem in the south-eastern part of the country, especially in starch potato crops. Both A. solani and A. alternata have been detected in the field, but A. solani was found more often [6]. Further investigations confirmed that early blight in south-eastern Sweden is mainly caused by A. solani [7].Effectiveness of host resistance and fungicide application can, to a great extent, be influenced by the genetic variation of pathogens [8]. Therefore, to improve plant disease management, knowledge about the genetic structure of the pathogen population should be taken into consideration [9]. Several studies point towards high genetic variation among isolates of A. solani, even though it is considered as an asexually reproducing fungus. Isozyme analyses revealed high genetic variation among isolates of A. solani from both potato and tomato in the USA [10] and this was subsequently confirmed using RAPD marker analysis [11]. Similarly, high genetic variability among South African isolates obtained from potato was observed by population analysis using random amplified microsatellite markers (RAMS) [12] and among Chinese isolates from potato using Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints [13]. However, in Sweden and other Nordic countries no studies of A. solani populations have been reported.AFLP remains a powerful and highly reproducible PCR-based technique for DNA-fingerprinting. Since this method does not require prior knowledge of genomic sequence and produces large number of polymorphic loci, it is still one of the most commonly used PCR based methods for genetic diversity analysis. This method has been used in several studies of genetic diversity in Alternaria species [9, 13, 14].The most common way of controlling early blight in Swedish potato production today is to treat the crop with Qol fungicides (strobilurins). This method has so far been efficient in controlling early blight [6]. However, strobilurins have been reported to show reduced efficacy against species of Alternaria in some parts of the USA [15–18]. Strains of A. solani that display reduced sensitivity to strobilurins have nucleotide substitutions in the amino acid codon at position 129 (referred to as F129L, phenylalanine has changed to leucine) in the gene encoding cytochrome b [17]. Recently, it has been discovered that A. solani in Europe carries two types of mitochondrial DNA. Populations carrying these two DNA types are referred to as genotype 1 (GI) and genotype 2 (GII) [19]. The latter resembles the American population of A. solani and can only be distinguished by PCR with special primers [15]. Analysis of Alternaria populations from Germany revealed the presence of the F129L substitution and the frequency of this substitution increased over the years [19]. Isolates that carried the F129L substitution had reduced in vitro sensitivity to Qol fungicides. In Sweden, observations of reduced field efficacy of strobilurins have been reported during the last few years, especially in the area around Kristianstad (personal communication with growers, advisors and the Swedish Board of Agriculture).The objectives of the present study were to: 1) examine the genetic diversity within and among populations of A. solani from two potato growing regions in south-eastern Sweden by applying AFLP marker analysis; 2) examine the cultured isolates for substitutions in the gene encoding cytochrome b that are associated with a loss of sensitivity to stroilurins."

                A total of 227 clear band was scored with 14 SSR primers and out of which 201 (88.6 %) were found polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) per primer pair varied from 62.5 to 100 % with an average of 86.9 %.

              "	"Tall fescue;SSR markers;Genetic diversity;Cultivar identification;Principal component analysis;Neighbor joining;Population structure"	"                        Festuca arundinacea Schreb., commonly known as tall fescue is the predominant cool-season perennial grass that is widely grown throughout the temperate regions of the world [1]. It forms the forage basis for beef cow and calf production and also is widely used as turf in lawns, parks, football fields, highway medians, and roadsides [2]. It is a cross-pollinated allohexaploid (2n =6Ã<U+0097>â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>42) with the genomic constitution PPG1G1G2G2 and a high degree of self-incompatibility [3, 4]. These features make breeding efforts generally focus on the development of superior synthetic cultivars or improved heterogeneous populations, both of which consist of genetically unique individuals that share many characters [5, 6]. Simultaneously, the relative drought tolerance of tall fescue and climatic changes are leading to increased cultivation in the transitional climates between temperate and subtropical zones [7]. The demand for forage type cultivars of tall fescue has resulted in the development and release of hundreds of cultivars since 1940s [7].The accurate description of genetic diversity in natural and artificial populations and identification of elite tall fescue cultivars rely on molecular techniques since morphological traits are easily vulnerable to environmental conditions and often showed the limited efficiency of detection of inter-varietal and intra-varietal polymorphisms on account of environmental plasticity [8]. Molecular marker analysis offers an efficient approach for assessing genetic diversity and germplasm characterization in cross-pollinated grass species [9, 10]. In view of cheapness and effectiveness, bulking strategy has been successfully employed to investigate genetic variation between cultivars of allogamous species [11]. Additionally, a value of 20 genotypes per population seems appropriate for most foragegrass species [12]. RFLP and AFLP have been used to distinguish several cultivars of tall fescue by pooled DNA samples [8, 13], but these methods require more technically demanding skills than conventional PCR markers [14]. Simple sequence repeats (SSR) have become one of the most widely used molecular marker systems in plant genetics due to the co-dominant inheritance, relative abundance, multi-allelic nature, extensive genome coverage, high reproducibility, and simple detection [15]. A large number of SSR markers have been developed for the Lolium/Festuca complex species, such as tall fescue [15, 16] and L. multiflorum [17]. Moreover, it has been reported that SSR markers has showed a high transferability across closely related species [18].To date, the old cultivar Kentucky-31 and its derived cultivars bred in North America have been widely introduced to other parts of the world as a forage base for beef, wool and dairy production [19]. However, there is little information about the genetic relationships between these popular cultivars. The objective of the present work, therefore, was (i) to reveal patterns of molecular polymorphism and (ii) to survey the extent of genetic variability and relationships among some elite cultivars of tall fescue from North America and Europe by using SSR markers and bulked samples. Here we wanted to confirm known genetic relationships among these cultivars based on recorded pedigrees and to evaluate the usefulness of SSR markers for germplasm identification."

It has a typical humid subtropical monsoon climate, luxuriantly diverse flora and fauna, including honey bees. The Mount Huang eastern honey bees (A. cerana) are an endemic population, which is well adapted to the local agricultural and ecological environment. They have a particularly strong foraging instinct and resistance to parasitic mites as well as American foulbrood. This endemic population was listed in the first directory of potential breeding stock for conservation in 2001. The A. cerana conservation document Wannan (Wan D/XM01-19-87) was published according to ecological standards in Anhui province. However, since then, a massive replacement of the endemic honey bees has occurred, especially after the importation of Apis mellifera [1]. In some regions, this has resulted in almost complete replacement of endemic A. cerana populations with imported stocks.Microsatellites are suitable nuclear markers used in population genetic studies in various taxonomic groups [2, 3]. This is due to their mass polymorphic loci, codominance, abundance throughout the genome, and relative ease of scoring [4]. The genetic structure of eastern honey bee populations from many regions of China have been analyzed using microsatellite markers. These regions mostly include areas in the middle east (Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces) and the south west (Tibei, Yunnan province and Hainan province). Zhu et al. [5] used five microsatellite loci to analyze the genetic structure of six A. cerana populations from Fujian province, their results showed that the mean expected heterozygosities (He) of populations from most of regions in Fujian was 0.5171 . In another study, a significant difference in genetic structures was found among honey bees from six regions in Wuyi Mountain located in Fujian province, the mean He of the six different region population was range from 0.4525–0.5613 [6]. Using six microsatellite loci, Ji et al. [7] found higher population heterozygosity and abundant genetic diversity in Apis cerana as well as in Apis mellifera (western European honey bee) populations in Jiangsu province, they found the mean He of A. cerana population in this province was 0.4424. Cao et al. [8] analyzed the genetic structure of more than ten A. cerana populations from different regions in Zhejiang province, their results showed that the genetic diversity of A. cerana in Zhejiang was relatively low, with the mean He was 0.3179. Guo et al. [9] used 8 microsatellite markers found the A. cerana populations in Qinling-Data mountain areas has rich genetic polymorphism, with the mean He, number of alleles, polymorphism information content (PIC) were 0.6877, 7.71, 3.7488 respectively. Ji et al. [10] found significant differentiation among 20 A. cerana populations from geographically different regions in China using 21 microsatellite loci. 502 alleles were found, and the average value of He of 21 microsatellites was 0.8689. Additionally, the mean He of the populations from Wuding (Yunnan province), Hainan, Bomi Tibet was 0.695, 0.6641 and 0.562 respectively, revealing their relatively high genetic diversity. Genetic diversity of A. cerana populations from Lushui in Yunnan province was evaluated with 21 microsatellite markers. 121 alleles were found, and the mean number of effective alleles was 5.76, the average He and PIC of all loci were 0.6752 and 0.6192, respectively, these results indicated the high level of genetic diversity in Lushui [11]. Six A. cerana populations distributed in different geographic areas in the south west Yunnan province were also surveyed using 21 microsatellite loci. All populations showed high levels of heterozygosity except the population from Diqing, the average He of the total populations was 0.739, and a significant genetic differentiation was found among all six populations [12]. Taken together, the genetic variation of A. cerana populations is overall higher in the southwest of China than in the middle east of China.However, information about genetic variation of A. cerana in Mount Huang of Anhui province, in south east China, is presently not available. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to examine the genetic structure of Mount Huang honey bee populations using microsatellite analyses. Our findings provide important information that can be used for effective management and conservation of A. cerana in Wannan."

Information about the amount and partitioning of genetic variation of this fungus could be helpful for improving orchard management strategies and for breeding apple cultivars with high levels of genetically determined resistance. In this study single-spore Neonectria isolates originating from both the same and from different perithecia, apple cultivars and apple orchards in Sweden and Belgium, were evaluated for AFLP- and SSR-based genetic similarity and for mating system.
              ;
                Results
                Seven SSR loci produced a total of 31 alleles with an average of 4 alleles per locus, while 11 AFLP primer combinations produced an average of 35 fragments per primer combination and 71 % polymorphic fragments. An AFLP-based analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 89 % of the variation was found within orchards and 11 % between orchards. Genetic similarity among the studied isolates was illustrated with a principal coordinate analyseis (PCoA) and a dendrogram. AFLP-based Jaccardâ<U+0080><U+0099>s similarity coefficients were the highest when single-ascospore isolates obtained from the same perithecium were compared, medium-high for isolates from different perithecia on the same tree, and lowest when isolates from different trees were compared.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Based on the results of PCoA and AMOVA analysis, isolates from the same or geographically close orchards did not group together. Since AFLP profiles differed also when single-ascospore isolates from the same perithecium were compared, the mating system of N. ditissima is most likely heterothallic.
              "	"AFLP;Apple canker;Genetic variability;Heterothallism;Mating system;SSR"	"The haploid fungus Neonectria ditissima (Tul. & C. Tul.) Samuels & Rossman, previously known as Neonectria galligena (Bres.) Rossman & Samuels, causes cankers on a wide range of trees and shrubs including apple (Malus) and pear (Pyrus). This pathogen can damage the woody tissue of infected trees substantially, and render fruit production unprofitable in certain areas [5]. Apple canker is mainly associated with mild and wet conditions, and climate therefore has an important impact on the geographic distribution of the pathogen [6]. This pathogen produces both conidia and ascospores under favorable conditions over prolonged periods [20, 33]. The spores usually enter the trees through natural and artificial wound sites e.g., pruning wounds, leaf scars, fruit scars due to chemical thinning or natural abscission, twig stubs, in the crotches of limbs, and even through lesions caused by apple scab. The spores can also be dispersed within and between orchards with infected equipment used by growers [20]. Since the pathogen can cause systemic infections that spread inside the plant, the use of infected rootstocks can probably lead to canker symptoms also in the grafted part (i.e. the proper cultivar) of young apple trees.In spite of the economic impacts of this pathogen, very little is known about the genetics of the causal agent. Most studies of Neonectria have focused on analyses of material from North America. In a study of Mahoney et al. [17], Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) of ribosomal, mitochondrial, and anonymous nuclear DNA was used to determine the origin of N. coccinea var. faginata in North America, and also to estimate haplotype and nucleotide diversity in this species as well as in N. ditissima. Plante et al. [25] investigated genetic diversity of N. ditissima and N. coccinea var. faginata using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and ribosomal DNA polymorphisms, and found that diversity of N. ditissima on various hardwood hosts in North America was higher than that of N. faginata (Nectria coccinea var. faginata). Based on a combined analysis of elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-Î±), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), and Î²-tubulin gene regions, Castlebury et al. [4] report that N. ditissima appears to consist of two major groups; one with primarily North American isolates, and another with European isolates from Fagus, Malus and Salix.Fungi can be self-fertile and undergo sexual reproduction (haploid selfing) on a single colony or be self-sterile and require two colonies of different mating types for sexual reproduction (out-crossing) [2]. However, many fungi can revert to haploid selfing if a suitable partner is not available.Studies of fungal population biology can assist in understanding the evolution of disease in agriculture and how it is affected by, e.g., the life cycle of the pathogen [26]. Population genetic analyses can also provide information about the amount of sexual recombination in fungal populations [32]. Sexual pathogen populations can produce new combinations of alleles including fungicide resistance alleles, which allow the pathogen to rapidly adapt to changes in the environment [21]. Analysis of sibling ascospore offspring can be used to more closely define the nature of mating systems [7]. Out-crossing was thus concluded when RAPD- and AFLP-markers detected genetic variation among sibling single-ascospore progeny from apothecia of Cladonia xoerkeana, C. galindezii, and C. portentosa [27]. However, previously collected data for N. ditissima are conflicting; based on the morphology of macroconidia and ascospores, El-Gholl et al. [9] reported this species to be homothallic while out-crossing was reported in an older study of ascospore morphology [14]."

The prediction and identification of enhancers are important but challenging issues for bioinformatics studies. Existing computational methods, mostly single classifiers, can only predict the transcriptional coactivator EP300 based enhancers and show low generalization performance.              ;
                Results
                We built a hybrid classifier called eRFSVM in this study, using random forests as a base classifier, and support vector machines as a main classifier. eRFSVM integrated two components as eRFSVM-ENCODE and eRFSVM-FANTOM5 with diverse features and labels. The base classifier trained datasets from a single tissue or cell with random forests. The main classifier made the final decision by support vector machines algorithm, with the predicting results of base classifiers as inputs. For eRFSVM-ENCODE, we trained datasets from cell lines including Gm12878, Hep, H1-hesc and Huvec, using ChIP-Seq datasets as features and EP300 based enhancers as labels. We tested eRFSVM-ENCODE on K562 dataset, and resulted in a predicting precision of 83.69 %, which was much better than existing classifiers. For eRFSVM-FANTOM5, with enhancers identified by RNA in FANTOM5 project as labels, the precision, recall, F-score and accuracy were 86.17 %, 36.06 %, 50.84 % and 93.38 % using eRFSVM, increasing 23.24 % (69.92 %), 97.05 % (18.30 %), 76.90 % (28.74 %), 4.69 % (89.20 %) than the existing algorithm, respectively.

                Conclusions
                All these results demonstrated that eRFSVM was a better classifier in predicting both EP300 based and FAMTOM5 RNAs based enhancers.
              "	"Enhancer;Hybrid classifier;Algorithm"	"Transcription regulation in human genes is a complex process. Systematic and precise identification of these regulatory DNA elements, especially enhancers [17] is a prerequisite to understand gene expression in both healthy and diseased cells [9]. More and more studies indicate that mutations in enhancers are associated with human diseases, such as cancers [7, 15], cardiovascular diseases [21] and immunological diseases [27].Enhancers increase the transcriptional output in cells manifesting distinct properties, which are summarized as follows: (a) enhancers are distal regulatory elements, which may locate 20kb or further away from transcription start sites, (b) they can activate gene transcription by recruiting transcription factors (TFs) and their complexes, (c) they may be enriched with chromatin modifications, such as monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and the acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac), (d) they can initiate RNA polymerase II transcription, producing a new class of non-coding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) [1], (e) they are tissue specific and merely conservative functioning in different spaces and stages. Thus, single experimental validation of them seems to be a time-consuming and costly task. Predicting enhancers based on conservation analysis of genomic sequences also doesn’t work well [23]. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the advanced computational tools make this task possible in the big data era.Machine learning algorithms [31] were used to predict enhancers with chromatin immune precipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) datasets [10, 30], such as the chromatin modification loci and the TF binding sites (TFBs) [24, 31]. Single classifiers used supervised learning algorithms, e.g., CSI-ANN [13] introduced an artificial neural network approach; RFECS [25] identified enhancers with RF; ChromaGenSVM [12] applied SVMs with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the parameters of SVMs; EnhancerFinder [11] used multi-kernel SVMs to predict enhancers in the eukaryotic genome; DEEP [18] used an algorithm combined SVMs with ANN including the components of DEEP-ENCODE and DEEP-FANTOM5.Some classifiers mentioned above, such as CSI-ANN, ChromaGenSVM, REFCS and EnhancerFinder used ChIP-Seq datasets as features, and were strongly relied on EP300, which was a transcriptional coactivator and could activate gene transcription by combining with TFs, considering EP300 binding sites as enhancers. However, EP300 binding sites are very possible enhancer sites, but not the 100 % real ones [19]. DEEP used the same datasets in predicting EP300 based enhancers as the classifiers mentioned above. It firstly used FANTOM5 datasets as training enhancers, which were reconstructed from enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) datasets using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) [14]. However, it used DNA sequence features as features not ChIP-Seq datasets in DEEP-FANTOM5. It used SVMs as base classifiers to train datasets from single tissues or cell lines and it used ANN as a main classifier to make the final decision combining the results of the base classifiers. It has been proved that getting the global optimum of ANN is a NP-hard problem. The simple implementing algorithm, back-propagation algorithm, is a heuristic algorithm, which is easy to trap in local optimal solution [26]. Thus, the weakness of DEEP was obvious. In the layer of algorithm, the predicting result was not the global optimum; in the layer of datasets, it didn’t use effective features in predicting eRNAs based enhancers.In this study, we built a hybrid classifier eRFSVM including eRFSVM-ENCODE and eRFSVM-FANTOM5. We used RF as base classifiers [3, 4], which was a fast and easy- paralleled algorithm good at dealing with unbalanced datasets. For eRFSVM, we could get the global optimum when making the final decision for both RF and SVMs algorithms were P problems [29].In the process of data pre-processing, to reduce unbalanced ratio, we used a sub-sampling algorithm, and combined it with the k-means method, comprehensively considering the running time for the program and the loss of information in samples. The base classifiers trained datasets from single tissues or cell lines with the RF algorithm, which used 60 % of the datasets for training and the remaining 40 % for testing. With the testing results of base classifiers, we built the main classifier with SVMs. For eRFSVM-ENCODE, we trained datasets of cell lines like Gm12878, Hep, H1-hesc and Huvec, and then tested datasets of Hela and K562 cell lines, with enhancers identified by transcriptional coactivator EP300 binding sets as labels. For eRFSVM-FANTOM5, we trained on datasets of blood, lung, liver, kidney, and then tested on the datasets of adipose, with eRNAs based enhancers as labels."

Earlier analyses of genetic diversity in a collection of 96 genebank accessions of timothy with SSR markers demonstrated high levels of diversity but could not resolve population structure. Therefore, we examined a subset of 51 accessions with REMAP markers, which are based on retrotransposons, and compared the diversity results with those obtained with SSR markers.              ;
                Results
                Using four primer combinations, 533 REMAP markers were analyzed, compared with 464 polymorphic alleles in the 13 SSR loci previously. The average marker index, which describes information obtained per experiment (per primer combination or locus) was over six times higher with REMAPs. Most of the variation found was within accessions, with somewhat less, 89 %, for REMAPs, than for SSR, with 93 %.
              ;
                Conclusions
                SSRs revealed differences in the level of diversity slightly better than REMAPs but neither marker type could reveal any clear clustering of accessions based on countries, vegetation zones, or different cultivar types. In our study, reliable evaluation of SSR allele dosages was not possible, so each allele had to be handled as a dominant marker. SSR and REMAP, which report from different mechanisms of generating genetic diversity and from different genomic regions, together indicate a lack of population structure. Taken together, this likely reflects the outcrossing and hexaploid nature of timothy rather than failures of either marker system.
              "	"Genetic diversity;Genetic structure;                        Phleum pratense L;REMAP;Retrotransposon marker;SSR;Microsatellite;Timothy"	"Timothy (Phleum pratense L.), a cool-season perennial, is the most important forage grass species in Nordic countries. Genetic diversity has been previously assessed [1] in a collection of 96 timothy accessions, of which 88 were of Nordic origin. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers revealed Nordic timothy accessions to be very polymorphic, having significant differences in the levels of diversity between countries, vegetation zones, and different cultivar types. However, most of the variation (94 %) existed within accessions, and no clear clustering of accessions based on any grouping was observed. This lack of resolution may either reflect the outcrossing and hexaploid nature of timothy or that SSR markers are not suitable for resolving population structure in timothy.A wide range of DNA markers are available for diversity studies, which all have their advantages and disadvantages. SSRs are amplified from single loci, but are multiallelic and highly polymorphic. Although they are inherited codominantly, separation of different genotypes may not be possible in a polyploid species such as timothy. Therefore, each allele has to be treated as a dominant marker [1]; consequently, the markers that are amplified from the same SSR locus are not independent of each other, and consequentially information is lost. In the REMAP (retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism) markers [2, 3] assay, the diversity is generated by the integration of retrotransposons, which move in the genome by a copy-and-paste mechanism but are fixed in position upon insertion [4]. They are ubiquitous and abundant in plant genomes, where they are dispersed on all chromosomes [5]. REMAP markers are amplified using a primer designed to a conserved retrotransposon region and another anchored to a simple sequence repeat. Products from multiple loci are produced in one PCR reaction, each with only two allele alternatives, a dominant one (amplification) and a recessive one (non-amplification). Because the mechanisms that activate retrotransposons [6] and thereby generate insertional polymorphisms are fully different than that generating SSR allelic variation (polymerase slippage) [7], the two marker systems assay different components of genetic diversity. For potato [8], alfalfa [9], and grapevine [10], retrotransposon and SSR markers in combination were shown to be highly discriminatory and effective.In the previous study [1], a collection of 96 timothy accessions was analyzed using 13 SSRs, thus describing diversity only at this number of loci. On the other hand, these 13 SSR loci harbored as many as 499 alleles. In the present study, we used REMAP markers for studying diversity in a subset of 51 accessions and compared the results with those obtained with SSR markers. We wanted to determine if another type of marker, which would report from many more locations in the genome and assess different genomic regions where diversity is generated by a different mechanism, could describe diversity more efficiently and also reveal population structure, particularly for a polyploid species. Especially the autonomous nature of retrotransposon diversity generation and display, which is independent of the syntenic organization of polyploids, appeared suited to clonal polyploid species such as timothy. We expected that the retrotransposon markers should thereby be more likely to find genetic structure in timothy, should it exist."

Evaluation of genetic variation in contemporary germplasm through breeding programs may be indirectly favorable for genetic progress in future cultivars [1]. Thus, estimation of plant diversity is crucial for the efficacious use of genetic resources in breeding programs. Molecular markers, as particular segments of DNA that represent different functional classes, play an essential role in all aspects of plant breeding, and have been widely used to estimate genetic variation.Compared with conventional phenotyping methods, molecular markers have numerous advantages as they are easily detectable and stable in plant tissues regardless of environmental influences [2]. The inter simple sequence repeat marker (ISSR) is highly polymorphic and is useful in studies of genetic diversity, genome mapping and evolutionary biology [3]. This PCR-based technique is used in various types of plants and can overcome many defects of other marker methods, such as high-cost of amplified fragment length (AFLP) and the low reproducibility of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [4]. Start codon targeted marker (SCoT) is a reliable and simple gene-targeted marker located on the translational start codon [5]. This technique involves designing single primers from the short conserved region flanking the ATG start codon [6] without knowing any further genomic sequence information. It has been used in peanut and mango crops for genetic diversity and cultivar relationship analysis [7]. Expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats marker (EST-SSR) detects variation based on the expressed portion of the genome from EST databases, thus explaining the low cost of development compared with the genomic simple sequence repeat marker (SSR) [8]. These EST-SSR primers can be used across various species for comparative mapping and the construction of genetic linkage maps [9, 10]. Each marker type has unique advantages and these three marker systems have found extensive application in the evaluation of genetic variation, population structure, and assisted selection for crop improvement [3, 11â<U+0080><U+0093>14]. Many studies have shown that these markers are mainly used to develop genetic linkage maps [15, 16], however, fewer studies have focused on constructing linkage disequilibrium (LD) maps. Remarkably, LD and linkage are two different genetic terms, where LD refers to correlation between alleles in a population, while LD means the correlated inheritance of loci through physical connection on a chromosome [17]. Some factors can affect the LD level, including allele frequency and recombination. Unlike linkage analysis, LD mapping relies on a natural population which is used to identify the relationships between genetic and phenotypic variation. LD mapping, that is association analysis, represents a useful tool to identify trait-marker relationships, and the first LD mapping of a quantitative trait was the analysis of flowering time and the dwarf8 gene in maize [18].Linkage disequilibrium (LD), referring to the nonrandom association of alleles between linked or unlinked loci, is the basis of association mapping to identify genetic regions associated with agronomic traits [17]. Recently, LD studies have been performed in various plants, such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) [19], barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) [20], Maize (Zea mays L.) [21], chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) [22], perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) [23], and the model legume, Medicago truncatula [24]. The level of LD is constantly regarded as a standard to reflect mapping resolution. Association mapping in populations with low LD requires a high number of markers, whereas a high LD means low mapping resolution [25]. In addition, information about population structure within germplasm collections is also crucial for the interpretation and identification of associations between genetic and functional diversity, and to assess whether the inter-sample relatedness is suitable for association studies [26â<U+0080><U+0093>28]. Therefore, population structure is also included as an effect in models used for association analysis. [15, 29].Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), as a warm season C4 perennial grass that is native to North America [30], is regarded as an important biofuel crop for its remarkable biomass yield and good adaptability on marginal lands thereby not competing with food crops on farmland [31â<U+0080><U+0093>33]. In this study, we explored two distinct forms of switchgrass, upland and lowland ecotypes. The upland accessions are distributed in northern cold areas with lower biomass than lowland varieties. Generally, upland switchgrass is shorter (â<U+0089>¤2.4 m, tall) than lowland types (â<U+0089>¥ 2.7 m) in favorable environments. However, lowland cultivars appear more sensitive to moisture stress than upland cultivars [34].Constructing association maps comparing the physiological and genetic basis of varying stresses can provide an available reference for the genetic improvement of switchgrass, and the evaluation of the level of LD and population structure can aid association analyses. To date, however, LD analysis across the switchgrass genome remains inadequate [35]. In our study, we present 134 switchgrass accessions supplied by Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit, Griffin, Georgia USA to identify the levels of genetic variation, population structure, and extent of LD using 51 markers including 16 ISSRs, 20 SCoTs, and 15 EST-SSRs. These results will provide a valuable molecular basis for enriching switchgrass genetic variation, and the information on the level of LD and population structure may guide association mapping using this representative collection.Here we constructed a three-marker molecular dataset with important applications for diversity analysis, establishment of population structure and evaluation of linkage disequilibrium in switchgrass which is an allogamous species."

                Results
                From cold-treated H. compressa plants, a putative DREB2 gene (HcDREB2) was cloned using the RACE-PCR method. HcDREB2 was 1296 bp in length and encoded a putative protein 264 amino acid residues long. HcDREB2 shared the highest sequence identity with DREB2 in sorghum. The expression of HcDREB2 was independent of ABA treatment, but inducible by low temperatures as well as drought and high salinity treatments. Yeast one-hybrid assays showed that HcDREB2 directly bound the DRE cis-acting element to transactivate the expression of the downstream reporter genes.
              ;
                Conclusions
                HcDREB2, a stress-inducible but ABA-independent transcription factor gene, can transactivate downstream genes by binding to the DRE cis-element. The current results are a foundation for making use of this stress tolerance gene in future H. compressa studies.
              "	"Cold stress;DREB transcription factor;Drought and salt stress;                Hemarthria compressa              ;Yeast one-hybrid system"	"                        Hemarthria compressa, commonly called whip grass, is a perennial grass in the family Gramineae. It is mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical zones, with a sparse distribution in the temperate-humid zones of the Northern Hemisphere. H. compressa is characterized by its long growing period, high growth rate, strong regenerative capacity, high yield, and strong stress tolerance. In southern China, H. compressa is an important forage grass, and is often used for soil and water conservation as well as ecological management [1, 2]. Most H. compressa studies have focused on agronomic characters, production performance, and genetic diversity. Currently, genetic information about H. compressa is very rare, and no sequence records of this important forage grass have been available in the NCBI GenBank until now. This limits research on functional genes, but transcription factors, as regulatory proteins that regulate signal transduction and gene expression, play an especially important role in exploring gene function. Therefore, identification and characterization of transcription factor will contribute to gene functional studies in H. compressa and other grasses.Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that can specifically bind to one or more cis-acting elements in the promoters of eukaryotic genes, thereby activating or inhibiting transcription. Based on conserved DNA domains, transcription factors are classified into various families such as AP2/ERF, MYB, WRKY, and bZIP. [1, 2]. AP2/ERF is a unique transcription factor family found in plants; it participates in plant development [3â<U+0080><U+0093>6], hormonal (ABA, ethylene, and others) responses, secondary metabolism, and responses to biotic or abiotic stresses [7, 8]. Based on similarities found in their AP2/ERF domains, Sakuma et al. [9] divided the transcription factors encoding the AP2/ERF domain in Arabidopsis into five groups: four sub-families (AP-2, RAV, DREB, and ERF) and the remaining transcription factors.The DREB (dehydration responsive element binding protein) subfamily genes play key roles in plant stress responses to low temperatures, drought, and high salinity environments [7, 10, 11]. DREB has a conserved AP2/ERF domain that can specifically bind to the DRE/CRT cis-acting element to activate expression of several stress-tolerance genes, thereby enhancing plant stress tolerance [7, 11, 12]. In Arabidopsis, DREB1A, DREB1B, and DREB1C play significant roles in cold-responsive gene expression. With respect to its AP2/EREBP domain, CBF4/DREB1D displays high homology with DREB1A; however, the expression of CBF4/DREB1D was induced by osmotic stresses instead of cold stress [9, 13]. DREB2A and DREB2B were contained in plants exposed to salinity or drought stresses, while DREB2C, DREB2D, and DREB2F were slightly induced in leaves by salinity treatment while DREB2E was slightly induced in roots by exogenous ABA treatment [9, 10].In recent years, DREB transcription factors have been identified in a large number of model plant species, including Nicotiana tabacum [14], Arabidopsis thaliana [9], and rice (Oryza sativa) [15],. DREB genes have been studied in forage crops as well. For example, Tang et al. [16] isolated a new DRE-binding protein gene, FaDREB1, from Festuca arundinacea using the rapid amplification of cDNA end-PCR (RACE-PCR) method, which discovered an AP2/ERFBP-type transcription factor and found that the FaDREB1 protein may be involved in the regulation of cold stress via the ABA-independent pathway. Xiong et al. [17] identified a DREB1A/CBF3-like gene LpCBF3 from perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and demonstrated that LpCBF3 is similar to DREB/CBF genes in Arabidopsis and is a functional transcription regulator in Arabidopsis. In alfalfa (Medicago falcata L.), two DRE-binding protein genes, MfDREB1s and MfDREB1, which encode AP2/EREBP-type transcription factors, were both found to be inducible by low-temperature stress [18]. Yet, the DREB family of genes in warm-season perennial grasses has been poorly examined so far.In this study, we used RACE-PCR to clone DREB transcription factor genes from H. compressa. Using to the conserved sequence of the AP2/ERF domain, we successfully cloned a full-length HcDREB2 gene from H. compressa. The HcDREB2 protein bound DRE cis-elements to transactivate the reporter gene in the yeast one-hybrid assay. Moreover, the expression level of HcDREB2 was highly induced by various stress treatments but not by ABA. No DREB genes were identified in H. compressa, and these experimental results provide the first valuable genetic information about the DREB gene family in this species. These results provide a foundation for stress-tolerance breeding in H. compressa through genetic engineering."

Several LEPR mutations and polymorphisms have been described in patients with early onset severe obesity and hyperphagic eating behavior; however, some contradictory findings have also been reported. In the present study we explored the association of six LEPR gene polymorphisms in patients with morbid obesity.              ;
                Findings
                Twenty eight patients with morbid obesity and 56 non-obese Mexican Mestizo individuals were included. Typing of rs1137100, rs1137101, rs1805134, Ser492Thr, rs1805094 and rs1805096 LEPR polymorphisms was performed by PCR and allele specific hybridization. The LEPR Ser492Thr polymorphism was monomorphic with the presence of only the Ser492Thr-G allele. Allele C and genotype T/C for rs1805134 polymorphism were associated with susceptibility to morbid obesity (pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.02 and pâ<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>0.03, respectively). No association was observed with any haplotype. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) showed that five polymorphisms (rs1137100, rs1137101, rs1805134, rs1805094 and rs1805096) were in absolute (Dâ<U+0080><U+0099>â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1) but none in perfect (r2â<U+0080><U+0089>=â<U+0080><U+0089>1) LD.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Our results suggest that rs1805134 polymorphism could be involved in the development of morbid obesity, whilst none of the alleles of the LEPR gene, rs1137100, rs1137101, rs1805094 and rs1805096 were associated as risk factors. However, more studies are necessary to confirm or reject this hypothesis.

The family consists of 35 genera sorted in two subfamilies. This study provides first insights into the phylogeny of Lentulidae. Two mitochondrial genes (12S and NDS) were sequenced and the phylogeny was inferred through Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference.              ;
                Results
                Our results indicate that the current classification into the subfamilies Lentulinae and Shelforditinae may be incorrect as Uvarovidium, Leatettix (Shelforditinae) and Devylderia (Lentulinae) clustered together in one main clade, while Betiscoides, Basutacris and Gymnidium (all Lentulinae) formed the second main clade. The genera Uvarovidium and Leatettix, which had been assigned to the Acrididae (subfamily Hemiacridinae) in the past, grouped within the Lentulidae, confirming their current assignment to this family. The East African Usambilla group is likely to represent a sister clade to the south African Lentula and Eremidium. Diversification patterns in the genus Devylderia and Betiscoides suggest a higher number of species than currently known.
              ;
                Conclusions
                Our phylogeny is not in line with the current systematics of Lentulidae, suggesting that a broader sampling and a study of the genitalia would be useful to clarify the taxonomy. Furthermore, some genera (particularly Betiscoides and Devylderia) are in need of taxonomic revision, as the number of species within these genera is likely to be higher than the current taxonomy suggests.
              "	"Biodiversity hotspot;Cape Floristic Region;Invertebrates;Orthoptera;Taxonomy"	"The Cape Floristic Region in South Africa is one of the global biodiversity hotspots [1]. Numerous studies have dealt with the enormous plant diversity and its origin and a number of phylogenetic studies on certain plant families aimed at unravelling the drivers for diversification in this region [2–4]. The fauna of the Cape Floristic Region, though not less unique, has not been investigated as intensely as the flora, especially research on invertebrate diversity remains still scarce [5]. Recent evidence suggests that invertebrate diversity and endemism in the Cape Floristic Region might be comparable to the pattern found in plants [5, 6]. The Cape Floristic Region also maintains a variety of endemic families, subfamilies and genera, suggesting that it provided refugia also over a longer time-span. One of these subfamilies endemic to the Cape Floristic Region is the subfamily Shelforditinae Ritchie, 1982 within the family Lentulidae Dirsh, 1956. Within the family Lentulidae as a whole, the majority of taxa (70 %) are also endemic to South Africa [7], but some genera occur in East Africa, particularly the Usambilla group, which shows a radiation in the East African mountain systems [8].All Lentulidae are completely wingless, and therefore expected to show high levels of genetic differentiation at a small geographic scale, as they have a low mobility and are often adapted to certain vegetation structures. For example, the Lentulidae genus Betiscoides Sjöstedt, 1923 is adapted to Restionaceae, which also show a high level of differentiation in the Cape Floristic Region [9]. Studies on the phylogenetics of grasshoppers from the Cape Floristic Region are lacking so far. However, several recent taxonomic studies suggest a high level of differentiation of flightless grasshopper species in the Cape Floristic Region with the identification of tens of hitherto undescribed species [10, 11]. Given the enormous number of unidentified species in times of increasing efforts to halt the loss of biodiversity, there have been approaches to record and assess biodiversity parameters also on higher taxonomic level [12]. Thus, it is of increasing interest to investigate the systematic relationships of endemic taxa to understand the importance of biodiversity hotspots.The aim of our study was to investigate and reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among genera within the family Lentulidae. We were particularly interested in the systematic position of the genera Leatettix Dirsh, 1956 and Uvarovidium Dirsh, 1956, which are currently assigned to the subfamily Shelforditinae. Furthermore, we aimed to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of the East African Usambilla group (here represented by the genera Usambilla Sjöstedt, 1910 and Rhainopomma Jago, 1981) with respect to the South African Lentulidae. We present the results of a first phylogenetic study on Lentulidae based upon two mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA and NDS – a fragment containing parts of the 16S rRNA, t-Leu and ND1), covering ten genera from both subfamilies, in order to provide new insights in evolutionary history of this family."

Kinesin-like protein 6 (KIF6) is a new candidate gene for CHD, since it has been identified as a potential risk factor. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of previously published association studies between the Trp719Arg polymorphism of KIF6 and the development of CHD.              ;                Methods                Studies and abstracts investigating the relationship between the Trp719Arg polymorphism of KIF6 and subsequent risk for development of CHD were reviewed. Electronic search from Pubmed and EBSCO databases was performed between 1993 and 2014 to identify studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. To analyze the association we used the models: allelic, additive, dominant and recessive. Moreover, we conducted a sub-analysis by populations using the same four models.

                Results
                Twenty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis. The Trp719Arg polymorphism showed a significant association with CHD when the analysis comprised the population with myocardial infarction (MI) and the additive genetic model was used. Moreover, this polymorphism showed a protective association with CHD when the analysis comprised the whole population using the recessive genetic model.

              "	"Cardiovascular disease;KIF6;Trp719Arg polymorphism;Meta-analysis;Systematic review"	"The risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors and often it is initially detected from clinical manifestations such as angina, myocardial infarction or sudden death due to artery occlusion [1]. Several environmental factors, such as obesity, oxidative stress, alcoholism, smoking and lack of exercise have been identified as risk factors for these diseases. In recent years, multiple genetic analysis studies have identified several loci and variants that are strongly associated with CHD [2, 3]. Kinesin-like protein 6 (KIF6) is considered a candidate gene for CHD, since it has been identified as a potential risk factor in European populations [4, 5]. KIF6 is a member of a family of molecular motors involved in intracellular transport of protein complexes, membrane organelles, and messenger ribonucleic acid along microtubules. This gene spans a genomic region of about 390,000 base pairs at human chromosome 6p21; moreover, it is ubiquitously expressed in coronary arteries and other vascular tissue [6, 7]. To date, multiple large prospective and case–control studies have reported an association of a common KIF6 gene polymorphism—Trp719Arg single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs20455)— with CHD risk. Carriers of the 719Arg allele exhibit a 50 % increased risk of events compared with non-carriers [5, 8]. However, some studies have not verified this conclusion. In view of the discrepancies in the findings of previous published studies, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between Trp719Arg in KIF6 and CHD to get a better understanding of this relationship."

              "	"Caprifig;                Ficus carica              ;Fig;Microsatellites;Moraceae;SSRs;Tunisia"	"The common fig (Ficus carica L.; 2n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2x<U+2009>=<U+2009>26) [1] belongs to the Moraceae, a family with over 1400 species distributed in about 40 genera. The genus Ficus L. contains about 750 species of woody trees, epiphytes and shrubs, mainly of tropical and subtropical distribution, divided into six subgenera [2, 3] that share a unique inflorescence, the syconium. Common fig seems to be originated from Southern Arabia and the eastern part of the Mediterranean regions and, together with the grapevine and the olive, is considered one of the three classical fruit trees associated with the beginning of horticulture in the Mediterranean Basin [4–6] domesticated at a very early stage contemporarily with cereal crops [7].                        Ficus carica L. is a gynodioecious species with two sexual forms: male trees (caprifigs) that produce syconia with separate male and female flowers and female trees that produce syconia with only female flowers that will develop into edible seeded figs if pollinated. Since only male trees produce pollen the common fig is functionally a dioecious species. Three types of female figs are cultivated [8]: the common-type that develops fruit parthenocarpically without pollination and can produce one (unifera varieties) or two (bifera varieties) crops, the Smyrna-type that requires pollination with pollen from caprifigs, and the San Pedro-type that produces a first crop parthenocarpically (breba) and a second crop (fig) only after pollination with pollen from caprifigs. Pollination in the genus Ficus is dependent on the coevolution of Ficus species with pollinating wasps of the family Agaonidae [9]. In the case of the common fig, pollination (caprification) is performed by a specific pollinating insect, Blastophaga psenes L. The caprifigs produce fruits in three crop cycles during each growing season, each harboring the larvae, pupae and, temporarily, the adults of the pollinating Blastophaga [8]: “profichi” that ripen in early summer, “mammoni” that ripen in autumn and “mamme” that overwinter on the tree and mature in spring. Only the \"profichi” carry pollen and are used for pollination. Pollination occurs naturally when female and caprifig trees are present in the same orchard or when caprifig branches with flowers are placed close to female fig trees. The main problems of caprification in Tunisia, which are common to other fig producing areas, are the disruption of the cycle of Blastophaga psenes in cold mountainous areas and the unavailability of mature caprifig “profichi” when female figs are receptive.In Tunisia, as in other Mediterranean countries [10], fig has been traditionally cultivated since ancient times in diverse edaphoclimatic conditions, in association with date palms in the south or olive trees in other regions of the country resulting in a high number of local varieties and frequent exchange of varieties among different regions [11, 12]. The denominations of the cultivars are usually based on the color, size and time of fruit ripening or geographical origin resulting in confusion in nomenclature. Hence, appropriate characterization and differentiation among cultivars is necessary to optimize fig germplasm management and conservation, jeopardized by intensive urbanization, cultivation of selected clonal varieties or biotic and abiotic stresses. This genetic erosion is even more important in caprifigs since they do not produce edible fruits and, consequently, the pressure to conserve genetic resources is lower. However, artificial caprification is still a common practice in Tunisian fig cultivation and, consequently, caprifigs are used by farmers in order to obtain edible fig production [12].Various studies have reported the use of morphological traits [11–19] and isozyme markers [20, 21] for fig characterization. However, these parameters are influenced by environmental conditions and the phenological status of the trees. To overcome these difficulties, different molecular tools such as RAPDs [13, 20–27] ISSRs [6, 19, 24, 26–28], AFLPs [20, 29, 30], RFLPs [6] or SSRs [6, 10, 26, 27, 30–41] have been used for fig germplasm characterization and diversity analyses. However, most of those studies include mainly female fig cultivars and molecular characterization and diversity studies in caprifigs are very scarce.The main objective of this study was to characterize and evaluate the genetic diversity of 20 Tunisian caprifig accessions using SSR markers in order to develop strategies to preserve the endangered genetic resources of this species."
